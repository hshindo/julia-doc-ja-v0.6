    "text": "科学分野におけるプログラミングはこれまで高いパフォーマンスが 要求されてきましたが、専門家たちは日々の仕事のために遅い動的 プログラミング言語へと移っていきました。動的プログラミング言語が 好まれる理由は多く、今後動的プログラミング言語の需要が 減ることはないでしょう。幸いにも、昨今の言語の設計と コンパイラ性能は、パフォーマンスのトレードオフを解消し、 また単一環境での試験的開発に十分な生産性と、 パフォーマンスに特化したアプリケーションの開発に十分な効率性を 提供しています。Juliaのプログラミング言語は、フレキシブルな 動的プログラミング言語であり、科学分野や計算処理におけるプ ログラミングに適し、これまでの静的プログラミング言語に 匹敵するパフォーマンスを提供します。JuliaのコンパイラはPythonやRなどに使用されている解釈プログラムとは 異なるため、はじめは直感的な操作ができないと感じるかもしれません。 もし操作性が悪いと感じた場合は、使用前に:Performance Tipsを お読みになることをお勧めします。Juliaの動きを理解された後には、 C言語を使用するのと同様のスピードで簡単にコードを入力することが できるでしょう。Juliaの特徴として、データの型予測の使用、およびLLVMによる JITコンパイル 実装による、オプションの入力、マルチディスパッチ、および高い性能を 実現したことが挙げられます。Juliaは、必須となる機能や実用性が高い機能、 およびオブジェクト指向のプログラミングの特徴を組み合わせた マルチパラダイムです。Juliaは、R、MATLABおよびPythonなどの言語と同様に、 高いレベルの計算処理における手軽さと見やすさを提供し、また一般的な プログラミングにも対応が可能です。この特性を実現するため、Juliaは数学的な プログラミング言語の系譜上に構築され、またLispやPerl、Python、LuaやRubyなど 多くの人々に支持された動的プログラミング言語も参考にしています。      Juliaが実現した、典型的な動的プログラミング言語からの最も 重要な発展は以下の通りです。標準ライブラリは、整数演算などの基本操作を含め、Julia自身により 作成されており、コア言語は非常に少なくなっています。\nオブジェクトの構築または記述する型の種類が豊富にあります。 オブジェクトはオプションとして型の宣言を行うために 使用することもできます。\nマルチディスパッチ により、引数の型の多くの組み合わせに対して関数の動作を 定義することが可能です。\n異なる引数の型の効率的な特殊コードの自動生成が可能です。\nC言語のような静的にコンパイルされた言語を使用しているかのような 高いパフォーマンスを発揮します。動的プログラミング言語は「型が不要」と言われることがありますが、 これは正しくはありません。たとえ単純なオブジェクトであったとしても、 またはユーザ定義によるものでも、すべてのオブジェクトには型があります。 多くの動的プログラミングにおいて型宣言をしないということは、 値の型をコンパイラに指示できない、もしくは型についてなにも 知らないことを意味します。一方静的プログラミング言語では、 コンパイラのために型の注釈をつけるとが可能であり、通常は必須です。 静的プログラミング言語では型はコンパイル時のみに必要であり、 実行時に変更したり記載することはできません。Juliaでは、型自体が 実行時のオブエクトであり、また型はコンパイラに情報を伝えるめに 使用することも可能です。一般的なプログラマは型やマルチティスパッチを使用する必要が ないかもしれませんが、関数が、異なる引数のタイプの 組み合わせにより定義されてることや、最も的確な定義のマッチング対して ディスパッチすることによって実行される点は、Juliaの特徴を統合する核です。 この仕組みは、従来のオブジェクト指向のディスパッチのように 最初の引数が処理を「占有」するといったことが一般的ではない、 数学的プログラミングに適しています。Juliaにおける操作者は特殊な 記号を伴う関数であると言えます。例えば、新しいユーザ定義のデータ型に 追加拡張するために、新しいメソッドを+関数に定義することができます。 既存コードはシームレスに新しいデータ型に適用されます。実行時型予測（オプションの型注釈により増大）およびこの プロジェクト当初からのパフォーマンス重視の姿勢により、 Juliaの計算効率は他の動的プログラミング言語や、さらには 静的プログラム言語に対しても上回っていると言えます。 過去数十年においてデータの処理量がムーアの法則のペースを 維持しながら増加していることからわかるように、 大規模な計算処理にとって処理速度はこれまで常に、 そしてこれからも非常に重要です。           Juliaは、単一言語での使いやすさ、処理能力、そして 処理効率の前例の無い連携を創造することを目的としています。 上記に加えて、以下は他のシステムには無いJuliaの利点です。フリーオープンソース（MITライセンス）\nユーザ定義の型は既存の型と同じくらい早く、コンパクト\nパフォーマンス向上のためにコードをベクトル化する必要がない 非ベクトル化コード処理は早い\n並列処理と分散計算ができるよう設計\n軽く「エコ」なスレッド（コルーチン）\n控えめでありながら処理能力が高いシステム\n簡潔かつ拡張可能な数値および他のデータ型のための変換と推進\n効率的なUTF-8 を含むUnicodeへの対応\nC関数を直接呼び出すことが可能（ラッパーや特別なAPIは不要）\n他のプロセスを管理するための処理能力が高いシェルに似た機能\nLispに似たマクロや他のメタプログラミング機能"

Juliaは -p または --machinefile オプションにより並列モードとして起動することができます。 -p n は n 個の 追加のワーカープロセスを起動し、 --machinefile file は file に記載されたそれぞれ一行に1つのワーカーを 起動します。 file に定義されたマシンはパスワード不要の ssh 接続が可能である必要があり、 またJuliaがインストールされた使用しているホストと同じ場所である必要があります。 それぞれのマシンの定義の方法は、 [count*][user@]host[:port] [bind_addr[:port]] となります。 user の デフォルトはカレントユーザ、 port は標準sshポートとなります。 count はノードに起動するワーカーの数であり、 デフォルトは1です。オプショナルの bind-to bind_addr[:port] は他のワーカーが使用してるワーカーに接続する際に 必要なIPアドレスとポートを指定します。 Juliaが実行されるたびに実行したいコードがある場合は、 ~/.juliarc.jl にそのコードを記載することが可能です。:$ echo 'println(\"Greetings! 你好! 안녕하세요?\")' > ~/.juliarc.jl\n$ julia\nGreetings! 你好! 안녕하세요?\n\n... perl や ruby と同様に、Juliaコードの実行やオプションを与えるための様々な方法があります。:julia [switches] -- [programfile] [args...]\n -v, --version             Display version information\n -h, --help                Print this message\n\n -J, --sysimage <file>     Start up with the given system image file\n --precompiled={yes|no}    Use precompiled code from system image if available\n --compilecache={yes|no}   Enable/disable incremental precompilation of modules\n -H, --home <dir>          Set location of `julia` executable\n --startup-file={yes|no}   Load ~/.juliarc.jl\n --handle-signals={yes|no} Enable or disable Julia's default signal handlers\n\n -e, --eval <expr>         Evaluate <expr>\n -E, --print <expr>        Evaluate and show <expr>\n -L, --load <file>         Load <file> immediately on all processors\n\n -p, --procs {N|auto}      Integer value N launches N additional local worker processes\n                           \"auto\" launches as many workers as the number of local cores\n --machinefile <file>      Run processes on hosts listed in <file>\n\n -i                        Interactive mode; REPL runs and isinteractive() is true\n -q, --quiet               Quiet startup (no banner)\n --color={yes|no}          Enable or disable color text\n --history-file={yes|no}   Load or save history\n\n --compile={yes|no|all|min}Enable or disable JIT compiler, or request exhaustive compilation\n -C, --cpu-target <target> Limit usage of cpu features up to <target>\n -O, --optimize={0,1,2,3}  Set the optimization level (default is 2 if unspecified or 3 if specified as -O)\n -g, -g <level>            Enable / Set the level of debug info generation (default is 1 if unspecified or 2 if specified as -g)\n --inline={yes|no}         Control whether inlining is permitted (overrides functions declared as @inline)\n --check-bounds={yes|no}   Emit bounds checks always or never (ignoring declarations)\n --math-mode={ieee,fast}   Disallow or enable unsafe floating point optimizations (overrides @fastmath declaration)\n\n --depwarn={yes|no|error}  Enable or disable syntax and method deprecation warnings (\"error\" turns warnings into errors)\n\n --output-o name           Generate an object file (including system image data)\n --output-ji name          Generate a system image data file (.ji)\n --output-bc name          Generate LLVM bitcode (.bc)\n --output-incremental=no   Generate an incremental output file (rather than complete)\n\n --code-coverage={none|user|all}, --code-coverage\n                           Count executions of source lines (omitting setting is equivalent to \"user\")\n --track-allocation={none|user|all}, --track-allocation\n                           Count bytes allocated by each source line"

Similarly for unary operators like ! or √, there is a corresponding .√ that applies the operator elementwise.julia> [1,2,3] .^ 3\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  1\n  8\n 27More specifically, a .^ b is parsed as the \"dot\" call (^).(a,b), which performs a broadcast operation: it can combine arrays and scalars, arrays of the same size (performing the operation elementwise), and even arrays of different shapes (e.g. combining row and column vectors to produce a matrix). Moreover, like all vectorized \"dot calls,\" these \"dot operators\" are fusing. For example, if you compute 2 .* A.^2 .+ sin.(A) (or equivalently @. 2A^2 + sin(A), using the @. macro) for an array A, it performs a single loop over A, computing 2a^2 + sin(a) for each element of A. In particular, nested dot calls like f.(g.(x)) are fused, and \"adjacent\" binary operators like x .+ 3 .* x.^2 are equivalent to nested dot calls (+).(x, (*).(3, (^).(x, 2))).Furthermore, \"dotted\" updating operators like a .+= b (or @. a += b) are parsed as a .= a .+ b, where .= is a fused in-place assignment operation (see the dot syntax documentation).Note the dot syntax is also applicable to user-defined operators. For example, if you define ⊗(A,B) = kron(A,B) to give a convenient infix syntax A ⊗ B for Kronecker products (kron), then [A,B] .⊗ [C,D] will compute [A⊗C, B⊗D] with no additional coding."

    "text": "Strings are finite sequences of characters. Of course, the real trouble comes when one asks what a character is. The characters that English speakers are familiar with are the letters A, B, C, etc., together with numerals and common punctuation symbols. These characters are standardized together with a mapping to integer values between 0 and 127 by the ASCII standard. There are, of course, many other characters used in non-English languages, including variants of the ASCII characters with accents and other modifications, related scripts such as Cyrillic and Greek, and scripts completely unrelated to ASCII and English, including Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean. The Unicode standard tackles the complexities of what exactly a character is, and is generally accepted as the definitive standard addressing this problem. Depending on your needs, you can either ignore these complexities entirely and just pretend that only ASCII characters exist, or you can write code that can handle any of the characters or encodings that one may encounter when handling non-ASCII text. Julia makes dealing with plain ASCII text simple and efficient, and handling Unicode is as simple and efficient as possible. In particular, you can write C-style string code to process ASCII strings, and they will work as expected, both in terms of performance and semantics. If such code encounters non-ASCII text, it will gracefully fail with a clear error message, rather than silently introducing corrupt results. When this happens, modifying the code to handle non-ASCII data is straightforward.There are a few noteworthy high-level features about Julia's strings:The built-in concrete type used for strings (and string literals) in Julia is String. This supports the full range of Unicode characters via the UTF-8 encoding. (A transcode() function is provided to convert to/from other Unicode encodings.)\nAll string types are subtypes of the abstract type AbstractString, and external packages define additional AbstractString subtypes (e.g. for other encodings).  If you define a function expecting a string argument, you should declare the type as AbstractString in order to accept any string type.\nLike C and Java, but unlike most dynamic languages, Julia has a first-class type representing a single character, called Char. This is just a special kind of 32-bit primitive type whose numeric value represents a Unicode code point.\nAs in Java, strings are immutable: the value of an AbstractString object cannot be changed. To construct a different string value, you construct a new string from parts of other strings.\nConceptually, a string is a partial function from indices to characters: for some index values, no character value is returned, and instead an exception is thrown. This allows for efficient indexing into strings by the byte index of an encoded representation rather than by a character index, which cannot be implemented both efficiently and simply for variable-width encodings of Unicode strings."

As discussed above, in character literals, Unicode code points can be represented using Unicode \\u and \\U escape sequences, as well as all the standard C escape sequences. These can likewise be used to write string literals:julia> s = \"\\u2200 x \\u2203 y\"\n\"∀ x ∃ y\"Whether these Unicode characters are displayed as escapes or shown as special characters depends on your terminal's locale settings and its support for Unicode. String literals are encoded using the UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding, meaning that not all characters are encoded in the same number of bytes. In UTF-8, ASCII characters – i.e. those with code points less than 0x80 (128) – are encoded as they are in ASCII, using a single byte, while code points 0x80 and above are encoded using multiple bytes – up to four per character. This means that not every byte index into a UTF-8 string is necessarily a valid index for a character. If you index into a string at such an invalid byte index, an error is thrown:julia> s[1]\n'∀': Unicode U+2200 (category Sm: Symbol, math)\n\njulia> s[2]\nERROR: UnicodeError: invalid character index\n[...]\n\njulia> s[3]\nERROR: UnicodeError: invalid character index\n[...]\n\njulia> s[4]\n' ': ASCII/Unicode U+0020 (category Zs: Separator, space)In this case, the character ∀ is a three-byte character, so the indices 2 and 3 are invalid and the next character's index is 4; this next valid index can be computed by nextind(s,1), and the next index after that by nextind(s,4) and so on.Because of variable-length encodings, the number of characters in a string (given by length(s)) is not always the same as the last index. If you iterate through the indices 1 through endof(s) and index into s, the sequence of characters returned when errors aren't thrown is the sequence of characters comprising the string s. Thus we have the identity that length(s) <= endof(s), since each character in a string must have its own index. The following is an inefficient and verbose way to iterate through the characters of s:julia> for i = 1:endof(s)\n           try\n               println(s[i])\n           catch\n               # ignore the index error\n           end\n       end\n∀\n\nx\n\n∃\n\nyThe blank lines actually have spaces on them. Fortunately, the above awkward idiom is unnecessary for iterating through the characters in a string, since you can just use the string as an iterable object, no exception handling required:julia> for c in s\n           println(c)\n       end\n∀\n\nx\n\n∃\n\nyJulia uses the UTF-8 encoding by default, and support for new encodings can be added by packages. For example, the LegacyStrings.jl package implements UTF16String and UTF32String types. Additional discussion of other encodings and how to implement support for them is beyond the scope of this document for the time being. For further discussion of UTF-8 encoding issues, see the section below on byte array literals. The transcode() function is provided to convert data between the various UTF-xx encodings, primarily for working with external data and libraries."

An example of this is matrix addition, where A + B == B + A for any matrices A and B that have the same shape. In contrast, * typically denotes a noncommutative operation, where the order of the operands does matter. An example of this is matrix multiplication, where in general A * B != B * A. As with matrix multiplication, string concatenation is noncommutative: greet * whom != whom * greet. As such, * is a more natural choice for an infix string concatenation operator, consistent with common mathematical use.More precisely, the set of all finite-length strings S together with the string concatenation operator * forms a free monoid (S, *). The identity element of this set is the empty string, \"\".

Regular expressions are related to strings in two ways: the obvious connection is that regular expressions are used to find regular patterns in strings; the other connection is that regular expressions are themselves input as strings, which are parsed into a state machine that can be used to efficiently search for patterns in strings. In Julia, regular expressions are input using non-standard string literals prefixed with various identifiers beginning with r. The most basic regular expression literal without any options turned on just uses r\"...\":julia> r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\"\nr\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\"\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nRegexTo check if a regex matches a string, use ismatch():julia> ismatch(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"not a comment\")\nfalse\n\njulia> ismatch(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"# a comment\")\ntrueAs one can see here, ismatch() simply returns true or false, indicating whether the given regex matches the string or not. Commonly, however, one wants to know not just whether a string matched, but also how it matched. To capture this information about a match, use the match() function instead:julia> match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"not a comment\")\n\njulia> match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", \"# a comment\")\nRegexMatch(\"#\")If the regular expression does not match the given string, match() returns nothing – a special value that does not print anything at the interactive prompt. Other than not printing, it is a completely normal value and you can test for it programmatically:m = match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", line)\nif m === nothing\n    println(\"not a comment\")\nelse\n    println(\"blank or comment\")\nendIf a regular expression does match, the value returned by match() is a RegexMatch object. These objects record how the expression matches, including the substring that the pattern matches and any captured substrings, if there are any. This example only captures the portion of the substring that matches, but perhaps we want to capture any non-blank text after the comment character. We could do the following:julia> m = match(r\"^\\s*(?:#\\s*(.*?)\\s*$|$)\", \"# a comment \")\nRegexMatch(\"# a comment \", 1=\"a comment\")When calling match(), you have the option to specify an index at which to start the search. For example:julia> m = match(r\"[0-9]\",\"aaaa1aaaa2aaaa3\",1)\nRegexMatch(\"1\")\n\njulia> m = match(r\"[0-9]\",\"aaaa1aaaa2aaaa3\",6)\nRegexMatch(\"2\")\n\njulia> m = match(r\"[0-9]\",\"aaaa1aaaa2aaaa3\",11)\nRegexMatch(\"3\")You can extract the following info from a RegexMatch object:the entire substring matched: m.match\nthe captured substrings as an array of strings: m.captures\nthe offset at which the whole match begins: m.offset\nthe offsets of the captured substrings as a vector: m.offsetsFor when a capture doesn't match, instead of a substring, m.captures contains nothing in that position, and m.offsets has a zero offset (recall that indices in Julia are 1-based, so a zero offset into a string is invalid). Here is a pair of somewhat contrived examples:julia> m = match(r\"(a|b)(c)?(d)\", \"acd\")\nRegexMatch(\"acd\", 1=\"a\", 2=\"c\", 3=\"d\")\n\njulia> m.match\n\"acd\"\n\njulia> m.captures\n3-element Array{Union{SubString{String}, Void},1}:\n \"a\"\n \"c\"\n \"d\"\n\njulia> m.offset\n1\n\njulia> m.offsets\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> m = match(r\"(a|b)(c)?(d)\", \"ad\")\nRegexMatch(\"ad\", 1=\"a\", 2=nothing, 3=\"d\")\n\njulia> m.match\n\"ad\"\n\njulia> m.captures\n3-element Array{Union{SubString{String}, Void},1}:\n \"a\"\n nothing\n \"d\"\n\njulia> m.offset\n1\n\njulia> m.offsets\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 0\n 2It is convenient to have captures returned as an array so that one can use destructuring syntax to bind them to local variables:julia> first, second, third = m.captures; first\n\"a\"Captures can also be accessed by indexing the RegexMatch object with the number or name of the capture group:julia> m=match(r\"(?<hour>\\d+):(?<minute>\\d+)\",\"12:45\")\nRegexMatch(\"12:45\", hour=\"12\", minute=\"45\")\n\njulia> m[:minute]\n\"45\"\n\njulia> m[2]\n\"45\"Captures can be referenced in a substitution string when using replace() by using \\n to refer to the nth capture group and prefixing the subsitution string with s. Capture group 0 refers to the entire match object. Named capture groups can be referenced in the substitution with g<groupname>. For example:julia> replace(\"first second\", r\"(\\w+) (?<agroup>\\w+)\", s\"\\g<agroup> \\1\")\n\"second first\"Numbered capture groups can also be referenced as \\g<n> for disambiguation, as in:julia> replace(\"a\", r\".\", s\"\\g<0>1\")\n\"a1\"You can modify the behavior of regular expressions by some combination of the flags i, m, s, and x after the closing double quote mark. These flags have the same meaning as they do in Perl, as explained in this excerpt from the perlre manpage:i   Do case-insensitive pattern matching.\n\n    If locale matching rules are in effect, the case map is taken\n    from the current locale for code points less than 255, and\n    from Unicode rules for larger code points. However, matches\n    that would cross the Unicode rules/non-Unicode rules boundary\n    (ords 255/256) will not succeed.\n\nm   Treat string as multiple lines.  That is, change \"^\" and \"$\"\n    from matching the start or end of the string to matching the\n    start or end of any line anywhere within the string.\n\ns   Treat string as single line.  That is, change \".\" to match any\n    character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would\n    not match.\n\n    Used together, as r\"\"ms, they let the \".\" match any character\n    whatsoever, while still allowing \"^\" and \"$\" to match,\n    respectively, just after and just before newlines within the\n    string.\n\nx   Tells the regular expression parser to ignore most whitespace\n    that is neither backslashed nor within a character class. You\n    can use this to break up your regular expression into\n    (slightly) more readable parts. The '#' character is also\n    treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment, just as in\n    ordinary code.For example, the following regex has all three flags turned on:julia> r\"a+.*b+.*?d$\"ism\nr\"a+.*b+.*?d$\"ims\n\njulia> match(r\"a+.*b+.*?d$\"ism, \"Goodbye,\\nOh, angry,\\nBad world\\n\")\nRegexMatch(\"angry,\\nBad world\")Triple-quoted regex strings, of the form r\"\"\"...\"\"\", are also supported (and may be convenient for regular expressions containing quotation marks or newlines)."

    "text": "Another useful non-standard string literal is the byte-array string literal: b\"...\". This form lets you use string notation to express literal byte arrays – i.e. arrays of UInt8 values. The rules for byte array literals are the following:ASCII characters and ASCII escapes produce a single byte.\n\\x and octal escape sequences produce the byte corresponding to the escape value.\nUnicode escape sequences produce a sequence of bytes encoding that code point in UTF-8.There is some overlap between these rules since the behavior of \\x and octal escapes less than 0x80 (128) are covered by both of the first two rules, but here these rules agree. Together, these rules allow one to easily use ASCII characters, arbitrary byte values, and UTF-8 sequences to produce arrays of bytes. Here is an example using all three:julia> b\"DATA\\xff\\u2200\"\n8-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x44\n 0x41\n 0x54\n 0x41\n 0xff\n 0xe2\n 0x88\n 0x80The ASCII string \"DATA\" corresponds to the bytes 68, 65, 84, 65. \\xff produces the single byte 255. The Unicode escape \\u2200 is encoded in UTF-8 as the three bytes 226, 136, 128. Note that the resulting byte array does not correspond to a valid UTF-8 string – if you try to use this as a regular string literal, you will get a syntax error:julia> \"DATA\\xff\\u2200\"\nERROR: syntax: invalid UTF-8 sequenceAlso observe the significant distinction between \\xff and \\uff: the former escape sequence encodes the byte 255, whereas the latter escape sequence represents the code point 255, which is encoded as two bytes in UTF-8:julia> b\"\\xff\"\n1-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0xff\n\njulia> b\"\\uff\"\n2-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0xc3\n 0xbfIn character literals, this distinction is glossed over and \\xff is allowed to represent the code point 255, because characters always represent code points. In strings, however, \\x escapes always represent bytes, not code points, whereas \\u and \\U escapes always represent code points, which are encoded in one or more bytes. For code points less than \\u80, it happens that the UTF-8 encoding of each code point is just the single byte produced by the corresponding \\x escape, so the distinction can safely be ignored. For the escapes \\x80 through \\xff as compared to \\u80 through \\uff, however, there is a major difference: the former escapes all encode single bytes, which – unless followed by very specific continuation bytes – do not form valid UTF-8 data, whereas the latter escapes all represent Unicode code points with two-byte encodings.If this is all extremely confusing, try reading \"The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets\". It's an excellent introduction to Unicode and UTF-8, and may help alleviate some confusion regarding the matter."

When entering a version literal, everything except the major version number is optional, therefore e.g.  v\"0.2\" is equivalent to v\"0.2.0\" (with empty pre-release/build annotations), v\"2\" is equivalent to v\"2.0.0\", and so on.VersionNumber objects are mostly useful to easily and correctly compare two (or more) versions. For example, the constant VERSION holds Julia version number as a VersionNumber object, and therefore one can define some version-specific behavior using simple statements as:if v\"0.2\" <= VERSION < v\"0.3-\"\n    # do something specific to 0.2 release series\nendNote that in the above example the non-standard version number v\"0.3-\" is used, with a trailing -: this notation is a Julia extension of the standard, and it's used to indicate a version which is lower than any 0.3 release, including all of its pre-releases.

In order to also allow for unstable (i.e. pre-release) 0.2 versions, the lower bound check should be modified like this: v\"0.2-\" <= VERSION.Another non-standard version specification extension allows one to use a trailing + to express an upper limit on build versions, e.g.  VERSION > v\"0.2-rc1+\" can be used to mean any version above 0.2-rc1 and any of its builds: it will return false for version v\"0.2-rc1+win64\" and true for v\"0.2-rc2\".It is good practice to use such special versions in comparisons (particularly, the trailing - should always be used on upper bounds unless there's a good reason not to), but they must not be used as the actual version number of anything, as they are invalid in the semantic versioning scheme.Besides being used for the VERSION constant, VersionNumber objects are widely used in the Pkg module, to specify packages versions and their dependencies."

Julia functions are not pure mathematical functions, in the sense that functions can alter and be affected by the global state of the program. The basic syntax for defining functions in Julia is:julia> function f(x,y)\n           x + y\n       end\nf (generic function with 1 method)There is a second, more terse syntax for defining a function in Julia. The traditional function declaration syntax demonstrated above is equivalent to the following compact \"assignment form\":julia> f(x,y) = x + y\nf (generic function with 1 method)In the assignment form, the body of the function must be a single expression, although it can be a compound expression (see Compound Expressions). Short, simple function definitions are common in Julia. The short function syntax is accordingly quite idiomatic, considerably reducing both typing and visual noise.A function is called using the traditional parenthesis syntax:julia> f(2,3)\n5Without parentheses, the expression f refers to the function object, and can be passed around like any value:julia> g = f;\n\njulia> g(2,3)\n5As with variables, Unicode can also be used for function names:julia> ∑(x,y) = x + y\n∑ (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> ∑(2, 3)\n5"

In conjunction with other control flow, however, return is of real use. Here, for example, is a function that computes the hypotenuse length of a right triangle with sides of length x and y, avoiding overflow:julia> function hypot(x,y)\n           x = abs(x)\n           y = abs(y)\n           if x > y\n               r = y/x\n               return x*sqrt(1+r*r)\n           end\n           if y == 0\n               return zero(x)\n           end\n           r = x/y\n           return y*sqrt(1+r*r)\n       end\nhypot (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> hypot(3, 4)\n5.0There are three possible points of return from this function, returning the values of three different expressions, depending on the values of x and y.

They can be used as arguments, and they can be returned as values. They can also be created anonymously, without being given a name, using either of these syntaxes:julia> x -> x^2 + 2x - 1\n(::#1) (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function (x)\n           x^2 + 2x - 1\n       end\n(::#3) (generic function with 1 method)This creates a function taking one argument x and returning the value of the polynomial x^2 + 2x - 1 at that value. Notice that the result is a generic function, but with a compiler-generated name based on consecutive numbering.The primary use for anonymous functions is passing them to functions which take other functions as arguments. A classic example is map(), which applies a function to each value of an array and returns a new array containing the resulting values:julia> map(round, [1.2,3.5,1.7])\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 4.0\n 2.0This is fine if a named function effecting the transform one wants already exists to pass as the first argument to map(). Often, however, a ready-to-use, named function does not exist. In these situations, the anonymous function construct allows easy creation of a single-use function object without needing a name:julia> map(x -> x^2 + 2x - 1, [1,3,-1])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n  2\n 14\n -2An anonymous function accepting multiple arguments can be written using the syntax (x,y,z)->2x+y-z. A zero-argument anonymous function is written as ()->3. The idea of a function with no arguments may seem strange, but is useful for \"delaying\" a computation. In this usage, a block of code is wrapped in a zero-argument function, which is later invoked by calling it as f()."

You can define a varargs function by following the last argument with an ellipsis:julia> bar(a,b,x...) = (a,b,x)\nbar (generic function with 1 method)The variables a and b are bound to the first two argument values as usual, and the variable x is bound to an iterable collection of the zero or more values passed to bar after its first two arguments:julia> bar(1,2)\n(1, 2, ())\n\njulia> bar(1,2,3)\n(1, 2, (3,))\n\njulia> bar(1, 2, 3, 4)\n(1, 2, (3, 4))\n\njulia> bar(1,2,3,4,5,6)\n(1, 2, (3, 4, 5, 6))In all these cases, x is bound to a tuple of the trailing values passed to bar.It is possible to constrain the number of values passed as a variable argument; this will be discussed later in Parametrically-constrained Varargs methods.On the flip side, it is often handy to \"splice\" the values contained in an iterable collection into a function call as individual arguments. To do this, one also uses ... but in the function call instead:julia> x = (3, 4)\n(3, 4)\n\njulia> bar(1,2,x...)\n(1, 2, (3, 4))In this case a tuple of values is spliced into a varargs call precisely where the variable number of arguments go.

Keyword arguments can make these complex interfaces easier to use and extend by allowing arguments to be identified by name instead of only by position.For example, consider a function plot that plots a line. This function might have many options, for controlling line style, width, color, and so on. If it accepts keyword arguments, a possible call might look like plot(x, y, width=2), where we have chosen to specify only line width. Notice that this serves two purposes. The call is easier to read, since we can label an argument with its meaning. It also becomes possible to pass any subset of a large number of arguments, in any order.Functions with keyword arguments are defined using a semicolon in the signature:function plot(x, y; style=\"solid\", width=1, color=\"black\")\n    ###\nendWhen the function is called, the semicolon is optional: one can either call plot(x, y, width=2) or plot(x, y; width=2), but the former style is more common. An explicit semicolon is required only for passing varargs or computed keywords as described below.Keyword argument default values are evaluated only when necessary (when a corresponding keyword argument is not passed), and in left-to-right order. Therefore default expressions may refer to prior keyword arguments.The types of keyword arguments can be made explicit as follows:function f(;x::Int64=1)\n    ###\nendExtra keyword arguments can be collected using ..., as in varargs functions:function f(x; y=0, kwargs...)\n    ###\nendInside f, kwargs will be a collection of (key,value) tuples, where each key is a symbol. Such collections can be passed as keyword arguments using a semicolon in a call, e.g. f(x, z=1; kwargs...). Dictionaries can also be used for this purpose.One can also pass (key,value) tuples, or any iterable expression (such as a => pair) that can be assigned to such a tuple, explicitly after a semicolon. For example, plot(x, y; (:width,2)) and plot(x, y; :width => 2) are equivalent to plot(x, y, width=2). This is useful in situations where the keyword name is computed at runtime.The nature of keyword arguments makes it possible to specify the same argument more than once. For example, in the call plot(x, y; options..., width=2) it is possible that the options structure also contains a value for width. In such a case the rightmost occurrence takes precedence; in this example, width is certain to have the value 2."

As an example, consider calling map() on a function with several cases:map(x->begin\n           if x < 0 && iseven(x)\n               return 0\n           elseif x == 0\n               return 1\n           else\n               return x\n           end\n       end,\n    [A, B, C])Julia provides a reserved word do for rewriting this code more clearly:map([A, B, C]) do x\n    if x < 0 && iseven(x)\n        return 0\n    elseif x == 0\n        return 1\n    else\n        return x\n    end\nendThe do x syntax creates an anonymous function with argument x and passes it as the first argument to map(). Similarly, do a,b would create a two-argument anonymous function, and a plain do would declare that what follows is an anonymous function of the form () -> ....How these arguments are initialized depends on the \"outer\" function; here, map() will sequentially set x to A, B, C, calling the anonymous function on each, just as would happen in the syntax map(func, [A, B, C]).This syntax makes it easier to use functions to effectively extend the language, since calls look like normal code blocks. There are many possible uses quite different from map(), such as managing system state. For example, there is a version of open() that runs code ensuring that the opened file is eventually closed:open(\"outfile\", \"w\") do io\n    write(io, data)\nendThis is accomplished by the following definition:function open(f::Function, args...)\n    io = open(args...)\n    try\n        f(io)\n    finally\n        close(io)\n    end\nendHere, open() first opens the file for writing and then passes the resulting output stream to the anonymous function you defined in the do ... end block. After your function exits, open() will make sure that the stream is properly closed, regardless of whether your function exited normally or threw an exception. (The try/finally construct will be described in Control Flow.)With the do block syntax, it helps to check the documentation or implementation to know how the arguments of the user function are initialized."

    "title": "Dot Syntax for Vectorizing Functions",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "In technical-computing languages, it is common to have \"vectorized\" versions of functions, which simply apply a given function f(x) to each element of an array A to yield a new array via f(A). This kind of syntax is convenient for data processing, but in other languages vectorization is also often required for performance: if loops are slow, the \"vectorized\" version of a function can call fast library code written in a low-level language. In Julia, vectorized functions are not required for performance, and indeed it is often beneficial to write your own loops (see Performance Tips), but they can still be convenient. Therefore, any Julia function f can be applied elementwise to any array (or other collection) with the syntax f.(A). For example sin can be applied to all elements in the vector A, like so:julia> A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 2.0\n 3.0\n\njulia> sin.(A)\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 0.841471\n 0.909297\n 0.14112Of course, you can omit the dot if you write a specialized \"vector\" method of f, e.g. via f(A::AbstractArray) = map(f, A), and this is just as efficient as f.(A). But that approach requires you to decide in advance which functions you want to vectorize.More generally, f.(args...) is actually equivalent to broadcast(f, args...), which allows you to operate on multiple arrays (even of different shapes), or a mix of arrays and scalars (see Broadcasting). For example, if you have f(x,y) = 3x + 4y, then f.(pi,A) will return a new array consisting of f(pi,a) for each a in A, and f.(vector1,vector2) will return a new vector consisting of f(vector1[i],vector2[i]) for each index i (throwing an exception if the vectors have different length).julia> f(x,y) = 3x + 4y;\n\njulia> A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0];\n\njulia> B = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0];\n\njulia> f.(pi, A)\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 13.4248\n 17.4248\n 21.4248\n\njulia> f.(A, B)\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 19.0\n 26.0\n 33.0Moreover, nested f.(args...) calls are fused into a single broadcast loop. For example, sin.(cos.(X)) is equivalent to broadcast(x -> sin(cos(x)), X), similar to [sin(cos(x)) for x in X]: there is only a single loop over X, and a single array is allocated for the result. [In contrast, sin(cos(X)) in a typical \"vectorized\" language would first allocate one temporary array for tmp=cos(X), and then compute sin(tmp) in a separate loop, allocating a second array.] This loop fusion is not a compiler optimization that may or may not occur, it is a syntactic guarantee whenever nested f.(args...) calls are encountered. Technically, the fusion stops as soon as a \"non-dot\" function call is encountered; for example, in sin.(sort(cos.(X))) the sin and cos loops cannot be merged because of the intervening sort function.Finally, the maximum efficiency is typically achieved when the output array of a vectorized operation is pre-allocated, so that repeated calls do not allocate new arrays over and over again for the results (Pre-allocating outputs:). A convenient syntax for this is X .= ..., which is equivalent to broadcast!(identity, X, ...) except that, as above, the broadcast! loop is fused with any nested \"dot\" calls. For example, X .= sin.(Y) is equivalent to broadcast!(sin, X, Y), overwriting X with sin.(Y) in-place. If the left-hand side is an array-indexing expression, e.g. X[2:end] .= sin.(Y), then it translates to broadcast! on a view, e.g. broadcast!(sin, view(X, 2:endof(X)), Y), so that the left-hand side is updated in-place.Since adding dots to many operations and function calls in an expression can be tedious and lead to code that is difficult to read, the macro @. is provided to convert every function call, operation, and assignment in an expression into the \"dotted\" version.julia> Y = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];\n\njulia> X = similar(Y); # pre-allocate output array\n\njulia> @. X = sin(cos(Y)) # equivalent to X .= sin.(cos.(Y))\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  0.514395\n -0.404239\n -0.836022\n -0.608083Binary (or unary) operators like .+ are handled with the same mechanism: they are equivalent to broadcast calls and are fused with other nested \"dot\" calls.  X .+= Y etcetera is equivalent to X .= X .+ Y and results in a fused in-place assignment;  see also "

Here's an example of a begin block:julia> z = begin\n           x = 1\n           y = 2\n           x + y\n       end\n3Since these are fairly small, simple expressions, they could easily be placed onto a single line, which is where the (;) chain syntax comes in handy:julia> z = (x = 1; y = 2; x + y)\n3This syntax is particularly useful with the terse single-line function definition form introduced in Functions. Although it is typical, there is no requirement that begin blocks be multiline or that (;) chains be single-line:julia> begin x = 1; y = 2; x + y end\n3\n\njulia> (x = 1;\n        y = 2;\n        x + y)\n3"

    "title": "Conditional Evaluation",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Conditional evaluation allows portions of code to be evaluated or not evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression. Here is the anatomy of the if-elseif-else conditional syntax:if x < y\n    println(\"x is less than y\")\nelseif x > y\n    println(\"x is greater than y\")\nelse\n    println(\"x is equal to y\")\nendIf the condition expression x < y is true, then the corresponding block is evaluated; otherwise the condition expression x > y is evaluated, and if it is true, the corresponding block is evaluated; if neither expression is true, the else block is evaluated. Here it is in action:julia> function test(x, y)\n           if x < y\n               println(\"x is less than y\")\n           elseif x > y\n               println(\"x is greater than y\")\n           else\n               println(\"x is equal to y\")\n           end\n       end\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(1, 2)\nx is less than y\n\njulia> test(2, 1)\nx is greater than y\n\njulia> test(1, 1)\nx is equal to yThe elseif and else blocks are optional, and as many elseif blocks as desired can be used. The condition expressions in the if-elseif-else construct are evaluated until the first one evaluates to true, after which the associated block is evaluated, and no further condition expressions or blocks are evaluated.if blocks are \"leaky\", i.e. they do not introduce a local scope. This means that new variables defined inside the if clauses can be used after the if block, even if they weren't defined before. So, we could have defined the test function above asjulia> function test(x,y)\n           if x < y\n               relation = \"less than\"\n           elseif x == y\n               relation = \"equal to\"\n           else\n               relation = \"greater than\"\n           end\n           println(\"x is \", relation, \" y.\")\n       end\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(2, 1)\nx is greater than y.The variable relation is declared inside the if block, but used outside. However, when depending on this behavior, make sure all possible code paths define a value for the variable. The following change to the above function results in a runtime errorjulia> function test(x,y)\n           if x < y\n               relation = \"less than\"\n           elseif x == y\n               relation = \"equal to\"\n           end\n           println(\"x is \", relation, \" y.\")\n       end\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(1,2)\nx is less than y.\n\njulia> test(2,1)\nERROR: UndefVarError: relation not defined\nStacktrace:\n [1] test(::Int64, ::Int64) at ./none:7if blocks also return a value, which may seem unintuitive to users coming from many other languages. This value is simply the return value of the last executed statement in the branch that was chosen, sojulia> x = 3\n3\n\njulia> if x > 0\n           \"positive!\"\n       else\n           \"negative...\"\n       end\n\"positive!\"Note that very short conditional statements (one-liners) are frequently expressed using Short-Circuit Evaluation in Julia, as outlined in the next section.Unlike C, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and Ruby – but like Java, and a few other stricter, typed languages – it is an error if the value of a conditional expression is anything but true or false:julia> if 1\n           println(\"true\")\n       end\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Int64) used in boolean contextThis error indicates that the conditional was of the wrong type: Int64 rather than the required Bool.The so-called \"ternary operator\", ?:, is closely related to the if-elseif-else syntax, but is used where a conditional choice between single expression values is required, as opposed to conditional execution of longer blocks of code. It gets its name from being the only operator in most languages taking three operands:a ? b : cThe expression a, before the ?, is a condition expression, and the ternary operation evaluates the expression b, before the :, if the condition a is true or the expression c, after the :, if it is false.The easiest way to understand this behavior is to see an example. In the previous example, the println call is shared by all three branches: the only real choice is which literal string to print. This could be written more concisely using the ternary operator. For the sake of clarity, let's try a two-way version first:julia> x = 1; y = 2;\n\njulia> println(x < y ? \"less than\" : \"not less than\")\nless than\n\njulia> x = 1; y = 0;\n\njulia> println(x < y ? \"less than\" : \"not less than\")\nnot less thanIf the expression x < y is true, the entire ternary operator expression evaluates to the string \"less than\" and otherwise it evaluates to the string \"not less than\". The original three-way example requires chaining multiple uses of the ternary operator together:julia> test(x, y) = println(x < y ? \"x is less than y\"    :\n                            x > y ? \"x is greater than y\" : \"x is equal to y\")\ntest (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> test(1, 2)\nx is less than y\n\njulia> test(2, 1)\nx is greater than y\n\njulia> test(1, 1)\nx is equal to yTo facilitate chaining, the operator associates from right to left.It is significant that like if-elseif-else, the expressions before and after the : are only evaluated if the condition expression evaluates to true or false, respectively:julia> v(x) = (println(x); x)\nv (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> 1 < 2 ? v(\"yes\") : v(\"no\")\nyes\n\"yes\"\n\njulia> 1 > 2 ? v(\"yes\") : v(\"no\")\nno\n\"no\""

    "title": "Short-Circuit Evaluation",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Short-circuit evaluation is quite similar to conditional evaluation. The behavior is found in most imperative programming languages having the && and || boolean operators: in a series of boolean expressions connected by these operators, only the minimum number of expressions are evaluated as are necessary to determine the final boolean value of the entire chain. Explicitly, this means that:In the expression a && b, the subexpression b is only evaluated if a evaluates to true.\nIn the expression a || b, the subexpression b is only evaluated if a evaluates to false.The reasoning is that a && b must be false if a is false, regardless of the value of b, and likewise, the value of a || b must be true if a is true, regardless of the value of b. Both && and || associate to the right, but && has higher precedence than || does. It's easy to experiment with this behavior:julia> t(x) = (println(x); true)\nt (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> f(x) = (println(x); false)\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> t(1) && t(2)\n1\n2\ntrue\n\njulia> t(1) && f(2)\n1\n2\nfalse\n\njulia> f(1) && t(2)\n1\nfalse\n\njulia> f(1) && f(2)\n1\nfalse\n\njulia> t(1) || t(2)\n1\ntrue\n\njulia> t(1) || f(2)\n1\ntrue\n\njulia> f(1) || t(2)\n1\n2\ntrue\n\njulia> f(1) || f(2)\n1\n2\nfalseYou can easily experiment in the same way with the associativity and precedence of various combinations of && and || operators.This behavior is frequently used in Julia to form an alternative to very short if statements. Instead of if <cond> <statement> end, one can write <cond> && <statement> (which could be read as: <cond> and then <statement>). Similarly, instead of if ! <cond> <statement> end, one can write <cond> || <statement> (which could be read as: <cond> or else <statement>).For example, a recursive factorial routine could be defined like this:julia> function fact(n::Int)\n           n >= 0 || error(\"n must be non-negative\")\n           n == 0 && return 1\n           n * fact(n-1)\n       end\nfact (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> fact(5)\n120\n\njulia> fact(0)\n1\n\njulia> fact(-1)\nERROR: n must be non-negative\nStacktrace:\n [1] fact(::Int64) at ./none:2Boolean operations without short-circuit evaluation can be done with the bitwise boolean operators introduced in 算術処理と基本的な関数: & and |. These are normal functions, which happen to support infix operator syntax, but always evaluate their arguments:julia> f(1) & t(2)\n1\n2\nfalse\n\njulia> t(1) | t(2)\n1\n2\ntrueJust like condition expressions used in if, elseif or the ternary operator, the operands of && or || must be boolean values (true or false). Using a non-boolean value anywhere except for the last entry in a conditional chain is an error:julia> 1 && true\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Int64) used in boolean contextOn the other hand, any type of expression can be used at the end of a conditional chain. It will be evaluated and returned depending on the preceding conditionals:julia> true && (x = (1, 2, 3))\n(1, 2, 3)\n\njulia> false && (x = (1, 2, 3))\nfalse"

    "page": "Control Flow",
    "title": "Repeated Evaluation: Loops",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "There are two constructs for repeated evaluation of expressions: the while loop and the for loop. Here is an example of a while loop:julia> i = 1;\n\njulia> while i <= 5\n           println(i)\n           i += 1\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5The while loop evaluates the condition expression (i <= 5 in this case), and as long it remains true, keeps also evaluating the body of the while loop. If the condition expression is false when the while loop is first reached, the body is never evaluated.The for loop makes common repeated evaluation idioms easier to write. Since counting up and down like the above while loop does is so common, it can be expressed more concisely with a for loop:julia> for i = 1:5\n           println(i)\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5Here the 1:5 is a Range object, representing the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The for loop iterates through these values, assigning each one in turn to the variable i. One rather important distinction between the previous while loop form and the for loop form is the scope during which the variable is visible. If the variable i has not been introduced in an other scope, in the for loop form, it is visible only inside of the for loop, and not afterwards. You'll either need a new interactive session instance or a different variable name to test this:julia> for j = 1:5\n           println(j)\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\njulia> j\nERROR: UndefVarError: j not definedSee Scope of Variables for a detailed explanation of variable scope and how it works in Julia.In general, the for loop construct can iterate over any container. In these cases, the alternative (but fully equivalent) keyword in or ∈ is typically used instead of =, since it makes the code read more clearly:julia> for i in [1,4,0]\n           println(i)\n       end\n1\n4\n0\n\njulia> for s ∈ [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]\n           println(s)\n       end\nfoo\nbar\nbazVarious types of iterable containers will be introduced and discussed in later sections of the manual (see, e.g., Multi-dimensional Arrays).It is sometimes convenient to terminate the repetition of a while before the test condition is falsified or stop iterating in a for loop before the end of the iterable object is reached. This can be accomplished with the break keyword:julia> i = 1;\n\njulia> while true\n           println(i)\n           if i >= 5\n               break\n           end\n           i += 1\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\njulia> for i = 1:1000\n           println(i)\n           if i >= 5\n               break\n           end\n       end\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5Without the break keyword, the above while loop would never terminate on its own, and the for loop would iterate up to 1000. These loops are both exited early by using break.In other circumstances, it is handy to be able to stop an iteration and move on to the next one immediately. The continue keyword accomplishes this:julia> for i = 1:10\n           if i % 3 != 0\n               continue\n           end\n           println(i)\n       end\n3\n6\n9This is a somewhat contrived example since we could produce the same behavior more clearly by negating the condition and placing the println call inside the if block. In realistic usage there is more code to be evaluated after the continue, and often there are multiple points from which one calls continue.Multiple nested for loops can be combined into a single outer loop, forming the cartesian product of its iterables:julia> for i = 1:2, j = 3:4\n           println((i, j))\n       end\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(2, 3)\n(2, 4)A break statement inside such a loop exits the entire nest of loops, not just the inner one."

    "title": "Tasks (aka Coroutines)",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Tasks are a control flow feature that allows computations to be suspended and resumed in a flexible manner. This feature is sometimes called by other names, such as symmetric coroutines, lightweight threads, cooperative multitasking, or one-shot continuations.When a piece of computing work (in practice, executing a particular function) is designated as a Task, it becomes possible to interrupt it by switching to another Task. The original Task can later be resumed, at which point it will pick up right where it left off. At first, this may seem similar to a function call. However there are two key differences. First, switching tasks does not use any space, so any number of task switches can occur without consuming the call stack. Second, switching among tasks can occur in any order, unlike function calls, where the called function must finish executing before control returns to the calling function.This kind of control flow can make it much easier to solve certain problems. In some problems, the various pieces of required work are not naturally related by function calls; there is no obvious \"caller\" or \"callee\" among the jobs that need to be done. An example is the producer-consumer problem, where one complex procedure is generating values and another complex procedure is consuming them. The consumer cannot simply call a producer function to get a value, because the producer may have more values to generate and so might not yet be ready to return. With tasks, the producer and consumer can both run as long as they need to, passing values back and forth as necessary.Julia provides a Channel mechanism for solving this problem. A Channel is a waitable first-in first-out queue which can have multiple tasks reading from and writing to it.Let's define a producer task, which produces values via the put! call. To consume values, we need to schedule the producer to run in a new task. A special Channel constructor which accepts a 1-arg function as an argument can be used to run a task bound to a channel. We can then take!() values repeatedly from the channel object:julia> function producer(c::Channel)\n           put!(c, \"start\")\n           for n=1:4\n               put!(c, 2n)\n           end\n           put!(c, \"stop\")\n       end;\n\njulia> chnl = Channel(producer);\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n\"start\"\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n2\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n4\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n6\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n8\n\njulia> take!(chnl)\n\"stop\"One way to think of this behavior is that producer was able to return multiple times. Between calls to put!(), the producer's execution is suspended and the consumer has control.The returned Channel can be used as an iterable object in a for loop, in which case the loop variable takes on all the produced values. The loop is terminated when the channel is closed.julia> for x in Channel(producer)\n           println(x)\n       end\nstart\n2\n4\n6\n8\nstopNote that we did not have to explicitly close the channel in the producer. This is because the act of binding a Channel to a Task() associates the open lifetime of a channel with that of the bound task. The channel object is closed automatically when the task terminates. Multiple channels can be bound to a task, and vice-versa.While the Task() constructor expects a 0-argument function, the Channel() method which creates a channel bound task expects a function that accepts a single argument of type Channel. A common pattern is for the producer to be parameterized, in which case a partial function application is needed to create a 0 or 1 argument anonymous function.For Task() objects this can be done either directly or by use of a convenience macro:function mytask(myarg)\n    ...\nend\n\ntaskHdl = Task(() -> mytask(7))\n# or, equivalently\ntaskHdl = @task mytask(7)To orchestrate more advanced work distribution patterns, bind() and schedule() can be used in conjunction with Task() and Channel() constructors to explicitly link a set of channels with a set of producer/consumer tasks.Note that currently Julia tasks are not scheduled to run on separate CPU cores. True kernel threads are discussed under the topic of Parallel Computing."

    "text": "Let us explore the low level construct yieldto() to underestand how task switching works. yieldto(task,value) suspends the current task, switches to the specified task, and causes that task's last yieldto() call to return the specified value. Notice that yieldto() is the only operation required to use task-style control flow; instead of calling and returning we are always just switching to a different task. This is why this feature is also called \"symmetric coroutines\"; each task is switched to and from using the same mechanism.yieldto() is powerful, but most uses of tasks do not invoke it directly. Consider why this might be. If you switch away from the current task, you will probably want to switch back to it at some point, but knowing when to switch back, and knowing which task has the responsibility of switching back, can require considerable coordination. For example, put!() and take!() are blocking operations, which, when used in the context of channels maintain state to remember who the consumers are. Not needing to manually keep track of the consuming task is what makes put!() easier to use than the low-level yieldto().In addition to yieldto(), a few other basic functions are needed to use tasks effectively.current_task() gets a reference to the currently-running task.\nistaskdone() queries whether a task has exited.\nistaskstarted() queries whether a task has run yet.\ntask_local_storage() manipulates a key-value store specific to the current task."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Most task switches occur as a result of waiting for events such as I/O requests, and are performed by a scheduler included in the standard library. The scheduler maintains a queue of runnable tasks, and executes an event loop that restarts tasks based on external events such as message arrival.The basic function for waiting for an event is wait(). Several objects implement wait(); for example, given a Process object, wait() will wait for it to exit. wait() is often implicit; for example, a wait() can happen inside a call to read() to wait for data to be available.In all of these cases, wait() ultimately operates on a Condition object, which is in charge of queueing and restarting tasks. When a task calls wait() on a Condition, the task is marked as non-runnable, added to the condition's queue, and switches to the scheduler. The scheduler will then pick another task to run, or block waiting for external events. If all goes well, eventually an event handler will call notify() on the condition, which causes tasks waiting for that condition to become runnable again.A task created explicitly by calling Task is initially not known to the scheduler. This allows you to manage tasks manually using yieldto() if you wish. However, when such a task waits for an event, it still gets restarted automatically when the event happens, as you would expect. It is also possible to make the scheduler run a task whenever it can, without necessarily waiting for any events. This is done by calling schedule(), or using the @schedule or @async macros (see Parallel Computing for more details)."

    "text": "The scope of a variable is the region of code within which a variable is visible. Variable scoping helps avoid variable naming conflicts. The concept is intuitive: two functions can both have arguments called x without the two x's referring to the same thing. Similarly there are many other cases where different blocks of code can use the same name without referring to the same thing. The rules for when the same variable name does or doesn't refer to the same thing are called scope rules; this section spells them out in detail.Certain constructs in the language introduce scope blocks, which are regions of code that are eligible to be the scope of some set of variables. The scope of a variable cannot be an arbitrary set of source lines; instead, it will always line up with one of these blocks. There are two main types of scopes in Julia, global scope and local scope, the latter can be nested. The constructs introducing scope blocks are:Scope name block/construct introducing this kind of scope\nGlobal Scope module, baremodule, at interactive prompt (REPL)\nLocal Scope Soft Local Scope: for, while, comprehensions, try-catch-finally, let\nLocal Scope Hard Local Scope: functions (either syntax, anonymous & do-blocks), struct, macroNotably missing from this table are begin blocks and if blocks, which do not introduce new scope blocks. All three types of scopes follow somewhat different rules which will be explained below as well as some extra rules for certain blocks.Julia uses lexical scoping, meaning that a function's scope does not inherit from its caller's scope, but from the scope in which the function was defined. For example, in the following code the x inside foo refers to the x in the global scope of its module Bar:julia> module Bar\n           x = 1\n           foo() = x\n       end;and not a x in the scope where foo is used:julia> import .Bar\n\njulia> x = -1;\n\njulia> Bar.foo()\n1Thus lexical scope means that the scope of variables can be inferred from the source code alone."

A local scope usually inherits all the variables from its parent scope, both for reading and writing. There are two subtypes of local scopes, hard and soft, with slightly different rules concerning what variables are inherited. Unlike global scopes, local scopes are not namespaces, thus variables in an inner scope cannot be retrieved from the parent scope through some sort of qualified access.The following rules and examples pertain to both hard and soft local scopes. A newly introduced variable in a local scope does not back-propagate to its parent scope. For example, here the z is not introduced into the top-level scope:julia> for i = 1:10\n           z = i\n       end\n\njulia> z\nERROR: UndefVarError: z not defined(Note, in this and all following examples it is assumed that their top-level is a global scope with a clean workspace, for instance a newly started REPL.)Inside a local scope a variable can be forced to be a local variable using the local keyword:julia> x = 0;\n\njulia> for i = 1:10\n           local x\n           x = i + 1\n       end\n\njulia> x\n0Inside a local scope a new global variable can be defined using the keyword global:julia> for i = 1:10\n           global z\n           z = i\n       end\n\njulia> z\n10The location of both the local and global keywords within the scope block is irrelevant. The following is equivalent to the last example (although stylistically worse):julia> for i = 1:10\n           z = i\n           global z\n       end\n\njulia> z\n10"

There are special scoping rules concerning the evaluation of default and keyword function arguments which are described in the Function section.An assignment introducing a variable used inside a function, type or macro definition need not come before its inner usage:julia> f = y -> y + a\n(::#1) (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> f(3)\nERROR: UndefVarError: a not defined\nStacktrace:\n [1] (::##1#2)(::Int64) at ./none:1\n\njulia> a = 1\n1\n\njulia> f(3)\n4This behavior may seem slightly odd for a normal variable, but allows for named functions – which are just normal variables holding function objects – to be used before they are defined. This allows functions to be defined in whatever order is intuitive and convenient, rather than forcing bottom up ordering or requiring forward declarations, as long as they are defined by the time they are actually called. As an example, here is an inefficient, mutually recursive way to test if positive integers are even or odd:julia> even(n) = n == 0 ? true : odd(n-1);\n\njulia> odd(n) = n == 0 ? false : even(n-1);\n\njulia> even(3)\nfalse\n\njulia> odd(3)\ntrueJulia provides built-in, efficient functions to test for oddness and evenness called iseven() and isodd() so the above definitions should only be taken as examples."

Remotely changing the state of global variables in other modules should be done with care and thus this is an opt-in feature requiring the global keyword.The reason to allow modifying local variables of parent scopes in nested functions is to allow constructing closures which have a private state, for instance the state variable in the following example:julia> let\n           state = 0\n           global counter\n           counter() = state += 1\n       end;\n\njulia> counter()\n1\n\njulia> counter()\n2See also the closures in the examples in the next two sections."

This difference is usually not important, and is only detectable in the case of variables that outlive their scope via closures. The let syntax accepts a comma-separated series of assignments and variable names:julia> x, y, z = -1, -1, -1;\n\njulia> let x = 1, z\n           println(\"x: $x, y: $y\") # x is local variable, y the global\n           println(\"z: $z\") # errors as z has not been assigned yet but is local\n       end\nx: 1, y: -1\nERROR: UndefVarError: z not definedThe assignments are evaluated in order, with each right-hand side evaluated in the scope before the new variable on the left-hand side has been introduced. Therefore it makes sense to write something like let x = x since the two x variables are distinct and have separate storage. Here is an example where the behavior of let is needed:julia> Fs = Array{Any}(2); i = 1;\n\njulia> while i <= 2\n           Fs[i] = ()->i\n           i += 1\n       end\n\njulia> Fs[1]()\n3\n\njulia> Fs[2]()\n3Here we create and store two closures that return variable i. However, it is always the same variable i, so the two closures behave identically. We can use let to create a new binding for i:julia> Fs = Array{Any}(2); i = 1;\n\njulia> while i <= 2\n           let i = i\n               Fs[i] = ()->i\n           end\n           i += 1\n       end\n\njulia> Fs[1]()\n1\n\njulia> Fs[2]()\n2Since the begin construct does not introduce a new scope, it can be useful to use a zero-argument let to just introduce a new scope block without creating any new bindings:julia> let\n           local x = 1\n           let\n               local x = 2\n           end\n           x\n       end\n1Since let introduces a new scope block, the inner local x is a different variable than the outer local x."

    "text": "Type systems have traditionally fallen into two quite different camps: static type systems, where every program expression must have a type computable before the execution of the program, and dynamic type systems, where nothing is known about types until run time, when the actual values manipulated by the program are available. Object orientation allows some flexibility in statically typed languages by letting code be written without the precise types of values being known at compile time. The ability to write code that can operate on different types is called polymorphism. All code in classic dynamically typed languages is polymorphic: only by explicitly checking types, or when objects fail to support operations at run-time, are the types of any values ever restricted.Julia's type system is dynamic, but gains some of the advantages of static type systems by making it possible to indicate that certain values are of specific types. This can be of great assistance in generating efficient code, but even more significantly, it allows method dispatch on the types of function arguments to be deeply integrated with the language. Method dispatch is explored in detail in Methods, but is rooted in the type system presented here.The default behavior in Julia when types are omitted is to allow values to be of any type. Thus, one can write many useful Julia programs without ever explicitly using types. When additional expressiveness is needed, however, it is easy to gradually introduce explicit type annotations into previously \"untyped\" code. Doing so will typically increase both the performance and robustness of these systems, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, often significantly simplify them.Describing Julia in the lingo of type systems, it is: dynamic, nominative and parametric. Generic types can be parameterized, and the hierarchical relationships between types are explicitly declared, rather than implied by compatible structure. One particularly distinctive feature of Julia's type system is that concrete types may not subtype each other: all concrete types are final and may only have abstract types as their supertypes. While this might at first seem unduly restrictive, it has many beneficial consequences with surprisingly few drawbacks. It turns out that being able to inherit behavior is much more important than being able to inherit structure, and inheriting both causes significant difficulties in traditional object-oriented languages. Other high-level aspects of Julia's type system that should be mentioned up front are:There is no division between object and non-object values: all values in Julia are true objects having a type that belongs to a single, fully connected type graph, all nodes of which are equally first-class as types.\nThere is no meaningful concept of a \"compile-time type\": the only type a value has is its actual type when the program is running. This is called a \"run-time type\" in object-oriented languages where the combination of static compilation with polymorphism makes this distinction significant.\nOnly values, not variables, have types – variables are simply names bound to values.\nBoth abstract and concrete types can be parameterized by other types. They can also be parameterized by symbols, by values of any type for which isbits() returns true (essentially, things like numbers and bools that are stored like C types or structs with no pointers to other objects), and also by tuples thereof. Type parameters may be omitted when they do not need to be referenced or restricted.Julia's type system is designed to be powerful and expressive, yet clear, intuitive and unobtrusive. Many Julia programmers may never feel the need to write code that explicitly uses types. Some kinds of programming, however, become clearer, simpler, faster and more robust with declared types."

There are two primary reasons to do this:As an assertion to help confirm that your program works the way you expect,\nTo provide extra type information to the compiler, which can then improve performance in some casesWhen appended to an expression computing a value, the :: operator is read as \"is an instance of\". It can be used anywhere to assert that the value of the expression on the left is an instance of the type on the right. When the type on the right is concrete, the value on the left must have that type as its implementation – recall that all concrete types are final, so no implementation is a subtype of any other. When the type is abstract, it suffices for the value to be implemented by a concrete type that is a subtype of the abstract type. If the type assertion is not true, an exception is thrown, otherwise, the left-hand value is returned:julia> (1+2)::AbstractFloat\nERROR: TypeError: typeassert: expected AbstractFloat, got Int64\n\njulia> (1+2)::Int\n3This allows a type assertion to be attached to any expression in-place.When appended to a variable on the left-hand side of an assignment, or as part of a local declaration, the :: operator means something a bit different: it declares the variable to always have the specified type, like a type declaration in a statically-typed language such as C. Every value assigned to the variable will be converted to the declared type using convert():julia> function foo()\n           x::Int8 = 100\n           x\n       end\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo()\n100\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nInt8This feature is useful for avoiding performance \"gotchas\" that could occur if one of the assignments to a variable changed its type unexpectedly.This \"declaration\" behavior only occurs in specific contexts:local x::Int8  # in a local declaration\nx::Int8 = 10   # as the left-hand side of an assignmentand applies to the whole current scope, even before the declaration. Currently, type declarations cannot be used in global scope, e.g. in the REPL, since Julia does not yet have constant-type globals.Declarations can also be attached to function definitions:function sinc(x)::Float64\n    if x == 0\n        return 1\n    end\n    return sin(pi*x)/(pi*x)\nendReturning from this function behaves just like an assignment to a variable with a declared type: the value is always converted to Float64."

We begin with abstract types even though they have no instantiation because they are the backbone of the type system: they form the conceptual hierarchy which makes Julia's type system more than just a collection of object implementations.Recall that in 整数と浮動小数点数, we introduced a variety of concrete types of numeric values: Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Int128, UInt128, Float16, Float32, and Float64.  Although they have different representation sizes, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64  and Int128 all have in common that they are signed integer types. Likewise UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64 and UInt128 are all unsigned integer types, while Float16, Float32 and Float64 are distinct in being floating-point types rather than integers. It is common for a piece of code to make sense, for example, only if its arguments are some kind of integer, but not really depend on what particular kind of integer.  For example, the greatest common denominator algorithm works for all kinds of integers, but will not work for floating-point numbers.  Abstract types allow the construction of a hierarchy of types, providing a context into which concrete types can fit.  This allows you, for example, to easily program to any type that is an integer, without restricting an algorithm to a specific type of integer.Abstract types are declared using the abstract type keyword. The general syntaxes for declaring an abstract type are:abstract type «name» end\nabstract type «name» <: «supertype» endThe abstract type keyword introduces a new abstract type, whose name is given by «name». This name can be optionally followed by <: and an already-existing type, indicating that the newly declared abstract type is a subtype of this \"parent\" type.When no supertype is given, the default supertype is Any – a predefined abstract type that all objects are instances of and all types are subtypes of. In type theory, Any is commonly called \"top\" because it is at the apex of the type graph. Julia also has a predefined abstract \"bottom\" type, at the nadir of the type graph, which is written as Union{}. It is the exact opposite of Any: no object is an instance of Union{} and all types are supertypes of Union{}.Let's consider some of the abstract types that make up Julia's numerical hierarchy:abstract type Number end\nabstract type Real     <: Number end\nabstract type AbstractFloat <: Real end\nabstract type Integer  <: Real end\nabstract type Signed   <: Integer end\nabstract type Unsigned <: Integer endThe Number type is a direct child type of Any, and Real is its child. In turn, Real has two children (it has more, but only two are shown here; we'll get to the others later): Integer and AbstractFloat, separating the world into representations of integers and representations of real numbers. Representations of real numbers include, of course, floating-point types, but also include other types, such as rationals. Hence, AbstractFloat is a proper subtype of Real, including only floating-point representations of real numbers. Integers are further subdivided into Signed and Unsigned varieties.The <: operator in general means \"is a subtype of\", and, used in declarations like this, declares the right-hand type to be an immediate supertype of the newly declared type. It can also be used in expressions as a subtype operator which returns true when its left operand is a subtype of its right operand:julia> Integer <: Number\ntrue\n\njulia> Integer <: AbstractFloat\nfalseAn important use of abstract types is to provide default implementations for concrete types. To give a simple example, consider:function myplus(x,y)\n    x+y\nendThe first thing to note is that the above argument declarations are equivalent to x::Any and y::Any. When this function is invoked, say as myplus(2,5), the dispatcher chooses the most specific method named myplus that matches the given arguments. (See Methods for more information on multiple dispatch.)Assuming no method more specific than the above is found, Julia next internally defines and compiles a method called myplus specifically for two Int arguments based on the generic function given above, i.e., it implicitly defines and compiles:function myplus(x::Int,y::Int)\n    x+y\nendand finally, it invokes this specific method.Thus, abstract types allow programmers to write generic functions that can later be used as the default method by many combinations of concrete types. Thanks to multiple dispatch, the programmer has full control over whether the default or more specific method is used.An important point to note is that there is no loss in performance if the programmer relies on a function whose arguments are abstract types, because it is recompiled for each tuple of argument concrete types with which it is invoked. (There may be a performance issue, however, in the case of function arguments that are containers of abstract types; see Performance Tips.)"

    "text": "A primitive type is a concrete type whose data consists of plain old bits. Classic examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Unlike most languages, Julia lets you declare your own primitive types, rather than providing only a fixed set of built-in ones. In fact, the standard primitive types are all defined in the language itself:primitive type Float16 <: AbstractFloat 16 end\nprimitive type Float32 <: AbstractFloat 32 end\nprimitive type Float64 <: AbstractFloat 64 end\n\nprimitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end\nprimitive type Char 32 end\n\nprimitive type Int8    <: Signed   8 end\nprimitive type UInt8   <: Unsigned 8 end\nprimitive type Int16   <: Signed   16 end\nprimitive type UInt16  <: Unsigned 16 end\nprimitive type Int32   <: Signed   32 end\nprimitive type UInt32  <: Unsigned 32 end\nprimitive type Int64   <: Signed   64 end\nprimitive type UInt64  <: Unsigned 64 end\nprimitive type Int128  <: Signed   128 end\nprimitive type UInt128 <: Unsigned 128 endThe general syntaxes for declaring a primitive type are:primitive type «name» «bits» end\nprimitive type «name» <: «supertype» «bits» endThe number of bits indicates how much storage the type requires and the name gives the new type a name. A primitive type can optionally be declared to be a subtype of some supertype. If a supertype is omitted, then the type defaults to having Any as its immediate supertype. The declaration of Bool above therefore means that a boolean value takes eight bits to store, and has Integer as its immediate supertype. Currently, only sizes that are multiples of 8 bits are supported. Therefore, boolean values, although they really need just a single bit, cannot be declared to be any smaller than eight bits.The types Bool, Int8 and UInt8 all have identical representations: they are eight-bit chunks of memory. Since Julia's type system is nominative, however, they are not interchangeable despite having identical structure. A fundamental difference between them is that they have different supertypes: Bool's direct supertype is Integer, Int8's is Signed, and UInt8's is Unsigned. All other differences between Bool, Int8, and UInt8 are matters of behavior – the way functions are defined to act when given objects of these types as arguments. This is why a nominative type system is necessary: if structure determined type, which in turn dictates behavior, then it would be impossible to make Bool behave any differently than Int8 or UInt8."

    "title": "Composite Types",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Composite types are called records, structs, or objects in various languages. A composite type is a collection of named fields, an instance of which can be treated as a single value. In many languages, composite types are the only kind of user-definable type, and they are by far the most commonly used user-defined type in Julia as well.In mainstream object oriented languages, such as C++, Java, Python and Ruby, composite types also have named functions associated with them, and the combination is called an \"object\". In purer object-oriented languages, such as Ruby or Smalltalk, all values are objects whether they are composites or not. In less pure object oriented languages, including C++ and Java, some values, such as integers and floating-point values, are not objects, while instances of user-defined composite types are true objects with associated methods. In Julia, all values are objects, but functions are not bundled with the objects they operate on. This is necessary since Julia chooses which method of a function to use by multiple dispatch, meaning that the types of all of a function's arguments are considered when selecting a method, rather than just the first one (see Methods for more information on methods and dispatch). Thus, it would be inappropriate for functions to \"belong\" to only their first argument. Organizing methods into function objects rather than having named bags of methods \"inside\" each object ends up being a highly beneficial aspect of the language design.Composite types are introduced with the struct keyword followed by a block of field names, optionally annotated with types using the :: operator:julia> struct Foo\n           bar\n           baz::Int\n           qux::Float64\n       endFields with no type annotation default to Any, and can accordingly hold any type of value.New objects of type Foo are created by applying the Foo type object like a function to values for its fields:julia> foo = Foo(\"Hello, world.\", 23, 1.5)\nFoo(\"Hello, world.\", 23, 1.5)\n\njulia> typeof(foo)\nFooWhen a type is applied like a function it is called a constructor. Two constructors are generated automatically (these are called default constructors). One accepts any arguments and calls convert() to convert them to the types of the fields, and the other accepts arguments that match the field types exactly. The reason both of these are generated is that this makes it easier to add new definitions without inadvertently replacing a default constructor.Since the bar field is unconstrained in type, any value will do. However, the value for baz must be convertible to Int:julia> Foo((), 23.5, 1)\nERROR: InexactError()\nStacktrace:\n [1] convert(::Type{Int64}, ::Float64) at ./float.jl:680\n [2] Foo(::Tuple{}, ::Float64, ::Int64) at ./none:2You may find a list of field names using the fieldnames function.julia> fieldnames(foo)\n3-element Array{Symbol,1}:\n :bar\n :baz\n :quxYou can access the field values of a composite object using the traditional foo.bar notation:julia> foo.bar\n\"Hello, world.\"\n\njulia> foo.baz\n23\n\njulia> foo.qux\n1.5Composite objects declared with struct are immutable; they cannot be modified after construction. This may seem odd at first, but it has several advantages:It can be more efficient. Some structs can be packed efficiently into arrays, and in some cases the compiler is able to avoid allocating immutable objects entirely.\nIt is not possible to violate the invariants provided by the type's constructors.\nCode using immutable objects can be easier to reason about.An immutable object might contain mutable objects, such as arrays, as fields. Those contained objects will remain mutable; only the fields of the immutable object itself cannot be changed to point to different objects.Where required, mutable composite objects can be declared with the keyword mutable struct, to be discussed in the next section.Composite types with no fields are singletons; there can be only one instance of such types:julia> struct NoFields\n       end\n\njulia> NoFields() === NoFields()\ntrueThe === function confirms that the \"two\" constructed instances of NoFields are actually one and the same. Singleton types are described in further detail below.There is much more to say about how instances of composite types are created, but that discussion depends on both Parametric Types and on Methods, and is sufficiently important to be addressed in its own section: Constructors."

A mutable object is like a little container that might hold different values over time, and so can only be reliably identified with its address. In contrast, an instance of an immutable type is associated with specific field values –- the field values alone tell you everything about the object. In deciding whether to make a type mutable, ask whether two instances with the same field values would be considered identical, or if they might need to change independently over time. If they would be considered identical, the type should probably be immutable.To recap, two essential properties define immutability in Julia:An object with an immutable type is passed around (both in assignment statements and in function calls) by copying, whereas a mutable type is passed around by reference.\nIt is not permitted to modify the fields of a composite immutable type.It is instructive, particularly for readers whose background is C/C++, to consider why these two properties go hand in hand.  If they were separated, i.e., if the fields of objects passed around by copying could be modified, then it would become more difficult to reason about certain instances of generic code.  For example, suppose x is a function argument of an abstract type, and suppose that the function changes a field: x.isprocessed = true.  Depending on whether x is passed by copying or by reference, this statement may or may not alter the actual argument in the calling routine.  Julia sidesteps the possibility of creating functions with unknown effects in this scenario by forbidding modification of fields of objects passed around by copying."

    "text": "An important and powerful feature of Julia's type system is that it is parametric: types can take parameters, so that type declarations actually introduce a whole family of new types – one for each possible combination of parameter values. There are many languages that support some version of generic programming, wherein data structures and algorithms to manipulate them may be specified without specifying the exact types involved. For example, some form of generic programming exists in ML, Haskell, Ada, Eiffel, C++, Java, C#, F#, and Scala, just to name a few. Some of these languages support true parametric polymorphism (e.g. ML, Haskell, Scala), while others support ad-hoc, template-based styles of generic programming (e.g. C++, Java). With so many different varieties of generic programming and parametric types in various languages, we won't even attempt to compare Julia's parametric types to other languages, but will instead focus on explaining Julia's system in its own right. We will note, however, that because Julia is a dynamically typed language and doesn't need to make all type decisions at compile time, many traditional difficulties encountered in static parametric type systems can be relatively easily handled.All declared types (the DataType variety) can be parameterized, with the same syntax in each case. We will discuss them in the following order: first, parametric composite types, then parametric abstract types, and finally parametric bits types."

What, one may ask, is T? Well, that's precisely the point of parametric types: it can be any type at all (or a value of any bits type, actually, although here it's clearly used as a type). Point{Float64} is a concrete type equivalent to the type defined by replacing T in the definition of Point with Float64. Thus, this single declaration actually declares an unlimited number of types: Point{Float64}, Point{AbstractString}, Point{Int64}, etc. Each of these is now a usable concrete type:julia> Point{Float64}\nPoint{Float64}\n\njulia> Point{AbstractString}\nPoint{AbstractString}The type Point{Float64} is a point whose coordinates are 64-bit floating-point values, while the type Point{AbstractString} is a \"point\" whose \"coordinates\" are string objects (see Strings).Point itself is also a valid type object, containing all instances Point{Float64}, Point{AbstractString}, etc. as subtypes:julia> Point{Float64} <: Point\ntrue\n\njulia> Point{AbstractString} <: Point\ntrueOther types, of course, are not subtypes of it:julia> Float64 <: Point\nfalse\n\njulia> AbstractString <: Point\nfalseConcrete Point types with different values of T are never subtypes of each other:julia> Point{Float64} <: Point{Int64}\nfalse\n\njulia> Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}\nfalsewarning: Warning\nThis last point is very important: even though Float64 <: Real we DO NOT have Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}.In other words, in the parlance of type theory, Julia's type parameters are invariant, rather than being covariant (or even contravariant). This is for practical reasons: while any instance of Point{Float64} may conceptually be like an instance of Point{Real} as well, the two types have different representations in memory:An instance of Point{Float64} can be represented compactly and efficiently as an immediate pair of 64-bit values;\nAn instance of Point{Real} must be able to hold any pair of instances of Real. Since objects that are instances of Real can be of arbitrary size and structure, in practice an instance of Point{Real} must be represented as a pair of pointers to individually allocated Real objects.The efficiency gained by being able to store Point{Float64} objects with immediate values is magnified enormously in the case of arrays: an Array{Float64} can be stored as a contiguous memory block of 64-bit floating-point values, whereas an Array{Real} must be an array of pointers to individually allocated Real objects – which may well be boxed 64-bit floating-point values, but also might be arbitrarily large, complex objects, which are declared to be implementations of the Real abstract type.Since Point{Float64} is not a subtype of Point{Real}, the following method can't be applied to arguments of type Point{Float64}:function norm(p::Point{Real})\n    sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)\nendA correct way to define a method that accepts all arguments of type Point{T} where T is a subtype of Real is:function norm(p::Point{<:Real})\n    sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)\nend(Equivalently, one could define function norm{T<:Real}(p::Point{T}) or function norm(p::Point{T} where T<:Real); see UnionAll Types.)More examples will be discussed later in Methods.How does one construct a Point object? It is possible to define custom constructors for composite types, which will be discussed in detail in Constructors, but in the absence of any special constructor declarations, there are two default ways of creating new composite objects, one in which the type parameters are explicitly given and the other in which they are implied by the arguments to the object constructor.Since the type Point{Float64} is a concrete type equivalent to Point declared with Float64 in place of T, it can be applied as a constructor accordingly:julia> Point{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Float64}For the default constructor, exactly one argument must be supplied for each field:julia> Point{Float64}(1.0)\nERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type Float64 to an object of type Point{Float64}\nThis may have arisen from a call to the constructor Point{Float64}(...),\nsince type constructors fall back to convert methods.\nStacktrace:\n [1] Point{Float64}(::Float64) at ./sysimg.jl:77\n\njulia> Point{Float64}(1.0,2.0,3.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point{Float64}(::Float64, ::Float64, ::Float64)Only one default constructor is generated for parametric types, since overriding it is not possible. This constructor accepts any arguments and converts them to the field types.In many cases, it is redundant to provide the type of Point object one wants to construct, since the types of arguments to the constructor call already implicitly provide type information. For that reason, you can also apply Point itself as a constructor, provided that the implied value of the parameter type T is unambiguous:julia> Point(1.0,2.0)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Float64}\n\njulia> Point(1,2)\nPoint{Int64}(1, 2)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Int64}In the case of Point, the type of T is unambiguously implied if and only if the two arguments to Point have the same type. When this isn't the case, the constructor will fail with a MethodError:julia> Point(1,2.5)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point(::Int64, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  Point(::T, !Matched::T) where T at none:2Constructor methods to appropriately handle such mixed cases can be defined, but that will not be discussed until later on in Constructors."

Thus, Ptr{Float64} and Ptr{Int64} are distinct types, even though they have identical representations.

    "text": "We have said that a parametric type like Ptr acts as a supertype of all its instances (Ptr{Int64} etc.). How does this work? Ptr itself cannot be a normal data type, since without knowing the type of the referenced data the type clearly cannot be used for memory operations. The answer is that Ptr (or other parametric types like Array) is a different kind of type called a UnionAll type. Such a type expresses the iterated union of types for all values of some parameter.UnionAll types are usually written using the keyword where. For example Ptr could be more accurately written as Ptr{T} where T, meaning all values whose type is Ptr{T} for some value of T. In this context, the parameter T is also often called a \"type variable\" since it is like a variable that ranges over types. Each where introduces a single type variable, so these expressions are nested for types with multiple parameters, for example Array{T,N} where N where T.The type application syntax A{B,C} requires A to be a UnionAll type, and first substitutes B for the outermost type variable in A. The result is expected to be another UnionAll type, into which C is then substituted. So A{B,C} is equivalent to A{B}{C}. This explains why it is possible to partially instantiate a type, as in Array{Float64}: the first parameter value has been fixed, but the second still ranges over all possible values. Using explicit where syntax, any subset of parameters can be fixed. For example, the type of all 1-dimensional arrays can be written as Array{T,1} where T.Type variables can be restricted with subtype relations. Array{T} where T<:Integer refers to all arrays whose element type is some kind of Integer. The syntax Array{<:Integer} is a convenient shorthand for Array{T} where T<:Integer. Type variables can have both lower and upper bounds. Array{T} where Int<:T<:Number refers to all arrays of Numbers that are able to contain Ints (since T must be at least as big as Int). The syntax where T>:Int also works to specify only the lower bound of a type variable, and Array{>:Int} is equivalent to Array{T} where T>:Int.Since where expressions nest, type variable bounds can refer to outer type variables. For example Tuple{T,Array{S}} where S<:AbstractArray{T} where T<:Real refers to 2-tuples whose first element is some Real, and whose second element is an Array of any kind of array whose element type contains the type of the first tuple element.The where keyword itself can be nested inside a more complex declaration.  For example, consider the two types created by the following declarations:julia> const T1 = Array{Array{T,1} where T, 1}\nArray{Array{T,1} where T,1}\n\njulia> const T2 = Array{Array{T,1}, 1} where T\nArray{Array{T,1},1} where TType T1 defines a 1-dimensional array of 1-dimensional arrays; each of the inner arrays consists of objects of the same type, but this type may vary from one inner array to the next. On the other hand, type T2 defines a 1-dimensional array of 1-dimensional arrays all of whose inner arrays must have the same type.  Note that T2 is an abstract type, e.g., Array{Array{Int,1},1} <: T2, whereas T1 is a concrete type. As a consequence, T1 can be constructed with a zero-argument constructor a=T1() but T2 cannot.There is a convenient syntax for naming such types, similar to the short form of function definition syntax:Vector{T} = Array{T,1}This is equivalent to const Vector = Array{T,1} where T. Writing Vector{Float64} is equivalent to writing Array{Float64,1}, and the umbrella type Vector has as instances all Array objects where the second parameter – the number of array dimensions – is 1, regardless of what the element type is. In languages where parametric types must always be specified in full, this is not especially helpful, but in Julia, this allows one to write just Vector for the abstract type including all one-dimensional dense arrays of any element type."

    "text": "Often, one wants to customize how instances of a type are displayed.  This is accomplished by overloading the show() function.  For example, suppose we define a type to represent complex numbers in polar form:julia> struct Polar{T<:Real} <: Number\n           r::T\n           Θ::T\n       end\n\njulia> Polar(r::Real,Θ::Real) = Polar(promote(r,Θ)...)\nPolarHere, we've added a custom constructor function so that it can take arguments of different Real types and promote them to a common type (see Constructors and Conversion and Promotion). (Of course, we would have to define lots of other methods, too, to make it act like a Number, e.g. +, *, one, zero, promotion rules and so on.) By default, instances of this type display rather simply, with information about the type name and the field values, as e.g. Polar{Float64}(3.0,4.0).If we want it to display instead as 3.0 * exp(4.0im), we would define the following method to print the object to a given output object io (representing a file, terminal, buffer, etcetera; see Networking and Streams):julia> Base.show(io::IO, z::Polar) = print(io, z.r, \" * exp(\", z.Θ, \"im)\")More fine-grained control over display of Polar objects is possible. In particular, sometimes one wants both a verbose multi-line printing format, used for displaying a single object in the REPL and other interactive environments, and also a more compact single-line format used for print() or for displaying the object as part of another object (e.g. in an array). Although by default the show(io, z) function is called in both cases, you can define a different multi-line format for displaying an object by overloading a three-argument form of show that takes the text/plain MIME type as its second argument (see Multimedia I/O), for example:julia> Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", z::Polar{T}) where{T} =\n           print(io, \"Polar{$T} complex number:\\n   \", z)(Note that print(..., z) here will call the 2-argument show(io, z) method.) This results in:julia> Polar(3, 4.0)\nPolar{Float64} complex number:\n   3.0 * exp(4.0im)\n\njulia> [Polar(3, 4.0), Polar(4.0,5.3)]\n2-element Array{Polar{Float64},1}:\n 3.0 * exp(4.0im)\n 4.0 * exp(5.3im)where the single-line show(io, z) form is still used for an array of Polar values.   Technically, the REPL calls display(z) to display the result of executing a line, which defaults to show(STDOUT, MIME(\"text/plain\"), z), which in turn defaults to show(STDOUT, z), but you should not define new display() methods unless you are defining a new multimedia display handler (see Multimedia I/O).Moreover, you can also define show methods for other MIME types in order to enable richer display (HTML, images, etcetera) of objects in environments that support this (e.g. IJulia).   For example, we can define formatted HTML display of Polar objects, with superscripts and italics, via:julia> Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/html\", z::Polar{T}) where {T} =\n           println(io, \"<code>Polar{$T}</code> complex number: \",\n                   z.r, \" <i>e</i><sup>\", z.Θ, \" <i>i</i></sup>\")A Polar object will then display automatically using HTML in an environment that supports HTML display, but you can call show manually to get HTML output if you want:julia> show(STDOUT, \"text/html\", Polar(3.0,4.0))\n<code>Polar{Float64}</code> complex number: 3.0 <i>e</i><sup>4.0 <i>i</i></sup><p>An HTML renderer would display this as: <code>Polar{Float64}</code> complex number: 3.0 <i>e</i><sup>4.0 <i>i</i></sup></p>"

However, you can dispatch on parametric types, and Julia allows you to include \"plain bits\" values (Types, Symbols, Integers, floating-point numbers, tuples, etc.) as type parameters.  A common example is the dimensionality parameter in Array{T,N}, where T is a type (e.g., Float64) but N is just an Int.You can create your own custom types that take values as parameters, and use them to control dispatch of custom types. By way of illustration of this idea, let's introduce a parametric type, Val{T}, which serves as a customary way to exploit this technique for cases where you don't need a more elaborate hierarchy.Val is defined as:julia> struct Val{T}\n       endThere is no more to the implementation of Val than this.

    "text": "Nullable objects represent values that are possibly missing, and it is possible to write all code using these objects by first testing to see if the value is missing with isnull(), and then doing an appropriate action. However, there are some common use cases where the code could be more concise or clear by using a higher-order function.The map function takes as arguments a function f and a Nullable value x. It produces a Nullable:If x is a missing value, then it produces a missing value;\nIf x has a value, then it produces a Nullable containing f(get(x)) as value.This is useful for performing simple operations on values that might be missing if the desired behaviour is to simply propagate the missing values forward.The filter function takes as arguments a predicate function p (that is, a function returning a boolean) and a Nullable value x. It produces a Nullable value:If x is a missing value, then it produces a missing value;\nIf p(get(x)) is true, then it produces the original value x;\nIf p(get(x)) is false, then it produces a missing value.In this way, filter can be thought of as selecting only allowable values, and converting non-allowable values to missing values.While map and filter are useful in specific cases, by far the most useful higher-order function is broadcast, which can handle a wide variety of cases, including making existing operations work and propagate Nullables. An example will motivate the need for broadcast. Suppose we have a function that computes the greater of two real roots of a quadratic equation, using the quadratic formula:julia> root(a::Real, b::Real, c::Real) = (-b + √(b^2 - 4a*c)) / 2a\nroot (generic function with 1 method)We may verify that the result of root(1, -9, 20) is 5.0, as we expect, since 5.0 is the greater of two real roots of the quadratic equation.Suppose now that we want to find the greatest real root of a quadratic equations where the coefficients might be missing values. Having missing values in datasets is a common occurrence in real-world data, and so it is important to be able to deal with them. But we cannot find the roots of an equation if we do not know all the coefficients. The best solution to this will depend on the particular use case; perhaps we should throw an error. However, for this example, we will assume that the best solution is to propagate the missing values forward; that is, if any input is missing, we simply produce a missing output.The broadcast() function makes this task easy; we can simply pass the root function we wrote to broadcast:julia> broadcast(root, Nullable(1), Nullable(-9), Nullable(20))\nNullable{Float64}(5.0)\n\njulia> broadcast(root, Nullable(1), Nullable{Int}(), Nullable{Int}())\nNullable{Float64}()\n\njulia> broadcast(root, Nullable{Int}(), Nullable(-9), Nullable(20))\nNullable{Float64}()If one or more of the inputs is missing, then the output of broadcast() will be missing.There exists special syntactic sugar for the broadcast() function using a dot notation:julia> root.(Nullable(1), Nullable(-9), Nullable(20))\nNullable{Float64}(5.0)In particular, the regular arithmetic operators can be broadcast() conveniently using .-prefixed operators:julia> Nullable(2) ./ Nullable(3) .+ Nullable(1.0)\nNullable{Float64}(1.66667)"

    "text": "Recall from Functions that a function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to a return value, or throws an exception if no appropriate value can be returned. It is common for the same conceptual function or operation to be implemented quite differently for different types of arguments: adding two integers is very different from adding two floating-point numbers, both of which are distinct from adding an integer to a floating-point number. Despite their implementation differences, these operations all fall under the general concept of \"addition\". Accordingly, in Julia, these behaviors all belong to a single object: the + function.To facilitate using many different implementations of the same concept smoothly, functions need not be defined all at once, but can rather be defined piecewise by providing specific behaviors for certain combinations of argument types and counts. A definition of one possible behavior for a function is called a method. Thus far, we have presented only examples of functions defined with a single method, applicable to all types of arguments. However, the signatures of method definitions can be annotated to indicate the types of arguments in addition to their number, and more than a single method definition may be provided. When a function is applied to a particular tuple of arguments, the most specific method applicable to those arguments is applied. Thus, the overall behavior of a function is a patchwork of the behaviors of its various method definitions. If the patchwork is well designed, even though the implementations of the methods may be quite different, the outward behavior of the function will appear seamless and consistent.The choice of which method to execute when a function is applied is called dispatch. Julia allows the dispatch process to choose which of a function's methods to call based on the number of arguments given, and on the types of all of the function's arguments. This is different than traditional object-oriented languages, where dispatch occurs based only on the first argument, which often has a special argument syntax, and is sometimes implied rather than explicitly written as an argument. [1] Using all of a function's arguments to choose which method should be invoked, rather than just the first, is known as multiple dispatch. Multiple dispatch is particularly useful for mathematical code, where it makes little sense to artificially deem the operations to \"belong\" to one argument more than any of the others: does the addition operation in x + y belong to x any more than it does to y? The implementation of a mathematical operator generally depends on the types of all of its arguments. Even beyond mathematical operations, however, multiple dispatch ends up being a powerful and convenient paradigm for structuring and organizing programs.[1]: In C++ or Java, for example, in a method call like obj.meth(arg1,arg2), the object obj \"receives\" the method call and is implicitly passed to the method via the this keyword, rather than as an explicit method argument. When the current this object is the receiver of a method call, it can be omitted altogether, writing just meth(arg1,arg2), with this implied as the receiving object."

    "text": "Until now, we have, in our examples, defined only functions with a single method having unconstrained argument types. Such functions behave just like they would in traditional dynamically typed languages. Nevertheless, we have used multiple dispatch and methods almost continually without being aware of it: all of Julia's standard functions and operators, like the aforementioned + function, have many methods defining their behavior over various possible combinations of argument type and count.When defining a function, one can optionally constrain the types of parameters it is applicable to, using the :: type-assertion operator, introduced in the section on Composite Types:julia> f(x::Float64, y::Float64) = 2x + y\nf (generic function with 1 method)This function definition applies only to calls where x and y are both values of type Float64:julia> f(2.0, 3.0)\n7.0Applying it to any other types of arguments will result in a MethodError:julia> f(2.0, 3)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Float64, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(::Float64, !Matched::Float64) at none:1\n\njulia> f(Float32(2.0), 3.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Float32, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(!Matched::Float64, ::Float64) at none:1\n\njulia> f(2.0, \"3.0\")\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Float64, ::String)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(::Float64, !Matched::Float64) at none:1\n\njulia> f(\"2.0\", \"3.0\")\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::String, ::String)As you can see, the arguments must be precisely of type Float64. Other numeric types, such as integers or 32-bit floating-point values, are not automatically converted to 64-bit floating-point, nor are strings parsed as numbers. Because Float64 is a concrete type and concrete types cannot be subclassed in Julia, such a definition can only be applied to arguments that are exactly of type Float64. It may often be useful, however, to write more general methods where the declared parameter types are abstract:julia> f(x::Number, y::Number) = 2x - y\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> f(2.0, 3)\n1.0This method definition applies to any pair of arguments that are instances of Number. They need not be of the same type, so long as they are each numeric values. The problem of handling disparate numeric types is delegated to the arithmetic operations in the expression 2x - y.To define a function with multiple methods, one simply defines the function multiple times, with different numbers and types of arguments. The first method definition for a function creates the function object, and subsequent method definitions add new methods to the existing function object. The most specific method definition matching the number and types of the arguments will be executed when the function is applied. Thus, the two method definitions above, taken together, define the behavior for f over all pairs of instances of the abstract type Number – but with a different behavior specific to pairs of Float64 values. If one of the arguments is a 64-bit float but the other one is not, then the f(Float64,Float64) method cannot be called and the more general f(Number,Number) method must be used:julia> f(2.0, 3.0)\n7.0\n\njulia> f(2, 3.0)\n1.0\n\njulia> f(2.0, 3)\n1.0\n\njulia> f(2, 3)\n1The 2x + y definition is only used in the first case, while the 2x - y definition is used in the others. No automatic casting or conversion of function arguments is ever performed: all conversion in Julia is non-magical and completely explicit. Conversion and Promotion, however, shows how clever application of sufficiently advanced technology can be indistinguishable from magic. [Clarke61]For non-numeric values, and for fewer or more than two arguments, the function f remains undefined, and applying it will still result in a MethodError:julia> f(\"foo\", 3)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::String, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(!Matched::Number, ::Number) at none:1\n\njulia> f()\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f()\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(!Matched::Float64, !Matched::Float64) at none:1\n  f(!Matched::Number, !Matched::Number) at none:1You can easily see which methods exist for a function by entering the function object itself in an interactive session:julia> f\nf (generic function with 2 methods)This output tells us that f is a function object with two methods. To find out what the signatures of those methods are, use the methods() function:julia> methods(f)\n# 2 methods for generic function \"f\":\n[1] f(x::Float64, y::Float64) in Main at none:1\n[2] f(x::Number, y::Number) in Main at none:1which shows that f has two methods, one taking two Float64 arguments and one taking arguments of type Number. It also indicates the file and line number where the methods were defined: because these methods were defined at the REPL, we get the apparent line number none:1.In the absence of a type declaration with ::, the type of a method parameter is Any by default, meaning that it is unconstrained since all values in Julia are instances of the abstract type Any. Thus, we can define a catch-all method for f like so:julia> f(x,y) = println(\"Whoa there, Nelly.\")\nf (generic function with 3 methods)\n\njulia> f(\"foo\", 1)\nWhoa there, Nelly.This catch-all is less specific than any other possible method definition for a pair of parameter values, so it is only be called on pairs of arguments to which no other method definition applies.Although it seems a simple concept, multiple dispatch on the types of values is perhaps the single most powerful and central feature of the Julia language. Core operations typically have dozens of methods:julia> methods(+)\n# 180 methods for generic function \"+\":\n[1] +(x::Bool, z::Complex{Bool}) in Base at complex.jl:227\n[2] +(x::Bool, y::Bool) in Base at bool.jl:89\n[3] +(x::Bool) in Base at bool.jl:86\n[4] +(x::Bool, y::T) where T<:AbstractFloat in Base at bool.jl:96\n[5] +(x::Bool, z::Complex) in Base at complex.jl:234\n[6] +(a::Float16, b::Float16) in Base at float.jl:373\n[7] +(x::Float32, y::Float32) in Base at float.jl:375\n[8] +(x::Float64, y::Float64) in Base at float.jl:376\n[9] +(z::Complex{Bool}, x::Bool) in Base at complex.jl:228\n[10] +(z::Complex{Bool}, x::Real) in Base at complex.jl:242\n[11] +(x::Char, y::Integer) in Base at char.jl:40\n[12] +(c::BigInt, x::BigFloat) in Base.MPFR at mpfr.jl:307\n[13] +(a::BigInt, b::BigInt, c::BigInt, d::BigInt, e::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:392\n[14] +(a::BigInt, b::BigInt, c::BigInt, d::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:391\n[15] +(a::BigInt, b::BigInt, c::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:390\n[16] +(x::BigInt, y::BigInt) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:361\n[17] +(x::BigInt, c::Union{UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8}) in Base.GMP at gmp.jl:398\n...\n[180] +(a, b, c, xs...) in Base at operators.jl:424Multiple dispatch together with the flexible parametric type system give Julia its ability to abstractly express high-level algorithms decoupled from implementation details, yet generate efficient, specialized code to handle each case at run time."

Thus, overall, this defines a boolean function that checks whether its two arguments are of the same type:julia> same_type(1, 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type(1, 2.0)\nfalse\n\njulia> same_type(1.0, 2.0)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type(\"foo\", 2.0)\nfalse\n\njulia> same_type(\"foo\", \"bar\")\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type(Int32(1), Int64(2))\nfalseSuch definitions correspond to methods whose type signatures are UnionAll types (see UnionAll Types).This kind of definition of function behavior by dispatch is quite common – idiomatic, even – in Julia. Method type parameters are not restricted to being used as the types of arguments: they can be used anywhere a value would be in the signature of the function or body of the function. Here's an example where the method type parameter T is used as the type parameter to the parametric type Vector{T} in the method signature:julia> myappend(v::Vector{T}, x::T) where {T} = [v..., x]\nmyappend (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> myappend([1,2,3],4)\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n\njulia> myappend([1,2,3],2.5)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching myappend(::Array{Int64,1}, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  myappend(::Array{T,1}, !Matched::T) where T at none:1\n\njulia> myappend([1.0,2.0,3.0],4.0)\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 2.0\n 3.0\n 4.0\n\njulia> myappend([1.0,2.0,3.0],4)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching myappend(::Array{Float64,1}, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  myappend(::Array{T,1}, !Matched::T) where T at none:1As you can see, the type of the appended element must match the element type of the vector it is appended to, or else a MethodError is raised. In the following example, the method type parameter T is used as the return value:julia> mytypeof(x::T) where {T} = T\nmytypeof (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> mytypeof(1)\nInt64\n\njulia> mytypeof(1.0)\nFloat64Just as you can put subtype constraints on type parameters in type declarations (see Parametric Types), you can also constrain type parameters of methods:julia> same_type_numeric(x::T, y::T) where {T<:Number} = true\nsame_type_numeric (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(x::Number, y::Number) = false\nsame_type_numeric (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(1, 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(1, 2.0)\nfalse\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(1.0, 2.0)\ntrue\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(\"foo\", 2.0)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching same_type_numeric(::String, ::Float64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  same_type_numeric(!Matched::T<:Number, ::T<:Number) where T<:Number at none:1\n  same_type_numeric(!Matched::Number, ::Number) at none:1\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(\"foo\", \"bar\")\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching same_type_numeric(::String, ::String)\n\njulia> same_type_numeric(Int32(1), Int64(2))\nfalseThe same_type_numeric function behaves much like the same_type function defined above, but is only defined for pairs of numbers.Parametric methods allow the same syntax as where expressions used to write types (see UnionAll Types). If there is only a single parameter, the enclosing curly braces (in where {T}) can be omitted, but are often preferred for clarity. Multiple parameters can be separated with commas, e.g. where {T, S<:Real}, or written using nested where, e.g. where S<:Real where T."

    "text": "When redefining a method or adding new methods, it is important to realize that these changes don't take effect immediately. This is key to Julia's ability to statically infer and compile code to run fast, without the usual JIT tricks and overhead. Indeed, any new method definition won't be visible to the current runtime environment, including Tasks and Threads (and any previously defined @generated functions). Let's start with an example to see what this means:julia> function tryeval()\n           @eval newfun() = 1\n           newfun()\n       end\ntryeval (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> tryeval()\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching newfun()\nThe applicable method may be too new: running in world age xxxx1, while current world is xxxx2.\nClosest candidates are:\n  newfun() at none:1 (method too new to be called from this world context.)\n in tryeval() at none:1\n ...\n\njulia> newfun()\n1In this example, observe that the new definition for newfun has been created, but can't be immediately called. The new global is immediately visible to the tryeval function, so you could write return newfun (without parentheses). But neither you, nor any of your callers, nor the functions they call, or etc. can call this new method definition!But there's an exception: future calls to newfun from the REPL work as expected, being able to both see and call the new definition of newfun.However, future calls to tryeval will continue to see the definition of newfun as it was at the previous statement at the REPL, and thus before that call to tryeval.You may want to try this for yourself to see how it works.The implementation of this behavior is a \"world age counter\". This monotonically increasing value tracks each method definition operation. This allows describing \"the set of method definitions visible to a given runtime environment\" as a single number, or \"world age\". It also allows comparing the methods available in two worlds just by comparing their ordinal value. In the example above, we see that the \"current world\" (in which the method newfun() exists), is one greater than the task-local \"runtime world\" that was fixed when the execution of tryeval started.Sometimes it is necessary to get around this (for example, if you are implementing the above REPL). Fortunately, there is an easy solution: call the function using Base.invokelatest:julia> function tryeval2()\n           @eval newfun2() = 2\n           Base.invokelatest(newfun2)\n       end\ntryeval2 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> tryeval2()\n2Finally, let's take a look at some more complex examples where this rule comes into play. Define a function f(x), which initially has one method:julia> f(x) = \"original definition\"\nf (generic function with 1 method)Start some other operations that use f(x):julia> g(x) = f(x)\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> t = @async f(wait()); yield();Now we add some new methods to f(x):julia> f(x::Int) = \"definition for Int\"\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> f(x::Type{Int}) = \"definition for Type{Int}\"\nf (generic function with 3 methods)Compare how these results differ:julia> f(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> g(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> wait(schedule(t, 1))\n\"original definition\"\n\njulia> t = @async f(wait()); yield();\n\njulia> wait(schedule(t, 1))\n\"definition for Int\""

For example, this definition:f(a=1,b=2) = a+2btranslates to the following three methods:f(a,b) = a+2b\nf(a) = f(a,2)\nf() = f(1,2)This means that calling f() is equivalent to calling f(1,2). In this case the result is 5, because f(1,2) invokes the first method of f above. However, this need not always be the case. If you define a fourth method that is more specialized for integers:f(a::Int,b::Int) = a-2bthen the result of both f() and f(1,2) is -3. In other words, optional arguments are tied to a function, not to any specific method of that function. It depends on the types of the optional arguments which method is invoked. When optional arguments are defined in terms of a global variable, the type of the optional argument may even change at run-time.Keyword arguments behave quite differently from ordinary positional arguments. In particular, they do not participate in method dispatch. Methods are dispatched based only on positional arguments, with keyword arguments processed after the matching method is identified."

In Julia, type objects also serve as constructor functions: they create new instances of themselves when applied to an argument tuple as a function. This much was already mentioned briefly when composite types were introduced. For example:julia> struct Foo\n           bar\n           baz\n       end\n\njulia> foo = Foo(1, 2)\nFoo(1, 2)\n\njulia> foo.bar\n1\n\njulia> foo.baz\n2For many types, forming new objects by binding their field values together is all that is ever needed to create instances. There are, however, cases where more functionality is required when creating composite objects. Sometimes invariants must be enforced, either by checking arguments or by transforming them. Recursive data structures, especially those that may be self-referential, often cannot be constructed cleanly without first being created in an incomplete state and then altered programmatically to be made whole, as a separate step from object creation. Sometimes, it's just convenient to be able to construct objects with fewer or different types of parameters than they have fields. Julia's system for object construction addresses all of these cases and more.[1]: Nomenclature: while the term \"constructor\" generally refers to the entire function which constructs objects of a type, it is common to abuse terminology slightly and refer to specific constructor methods as \"constructors\". In such situations, it is generally clear from context that the term is used to mean \"constructor method\" rather than \"constructor function\", especially as it is often used in the sense of singling out a particular method of the constructor from all of the others."

This is simple:julia> Foo(x) = Foo(x,x)\nFoo\n\njulia> Foo(1)\nFoo(1, 1)You could also add a zero-argument Foo constructor method that supplies default values for both of the bar and baz fields:julia> Foo() = Foo(0)\nFoo\n\njulia> Foo()\nFoo(0, 0)Here the zero-argument constructor method calls the single-argument constructor method, which in turn calls the automatically provided two-argument constructor method.

Since outer constructor methods can only create objects by calling other constructor methods, ultimately, some inner constructor must be called to create an object. This guarantees that all objects of the declared type must come into existence by a call to one of the inner constructor methods provided with the type, thereby giving some degree of enforcement of a type's invariants.If any inner constructor method is defined, no default constructor method is provided: it is presumed that you have supplied yourself with all the inner constructors you need. The default constructor is equivalent to writing your own inner constructor method that takes all of the object's fields as parameters (constrained to be of the correct type, if the corresponding field has a type), and passes them to new, returning the resulting object:julia> struct Foo\n           bar\n           baz\n           Foo(bar,baz) = new(bar,baz)\n       end\nThis declaration has the same effect as the earlier definition of the Foo type without an explicit inner constructor method. The following two types are equivalent – one with a default constructor, the other with an explicit constructor:julia> struct T1\n           x::Int64\n       end\n\njulia> struct T2\n           x::Int64\n           T2(x) = new(x)\n       end\n\njulia> T1(1)\nT1(1)\n\njulia> T2(1)\nT2(1)\n\njulia> T1(1.0)\nT1(1)\n\njulia> T2(1.0)\nT2(1)It is considered good form to provide as few inner constructor methods as possible: only those taking all arguments explicitly and enforcing essential error checking and transformation. Additional convenience constructor methods, supplying default values or auxiliary transformations, should be provided as outer constructors that call the inner constructors to do the heavy lifting. This separation is typically quite natural."

    "text": "The final problem which has still not been addressed is construction of self-referential objects, or more generally, recursive data structures. Since the fundamental difficulty may not be immediately obvious, let us briefly explain it. Consider the following recursive type declaration:julia> mutable struct SelfReferential\n           obj::SelfReferential\n       end\nThis type may appear innocuous enough, until one considers how to construct an instance of it. If a is an instance of SelfReferential, then a second instance can be created by the call:julia> b = SelfReferential(a)But how does one construct the first instance when no instance exists to provide as a valid value for its obj field? The only solution is to allow creating an incompletely initialized instance of SelfReferential with an unassigned obj field, and using that incomplete instance as a valid value for the obj field of another instance, such as, for example, itself.To allow for the creation of incompletely initialized objects, Julia allows the new function to be called with fewer than the number of fields that the type has, returning an object with the unspecified fields uninitialized. The inner constructor method can then use the incomplete object, finishing its initialization before returning it. Here, for example, we take another crack at defining the SelfReferential type, with a zero-argument inner constructor returning instances having obj fields pointing to themselves:julia> mutable struct SelfReferential\n           obj::SelfReferential\n           SelfReferential() = (x = new(); x.obj = x)\n       end\nWe can verify that this constructor works and constructs objects that are, in fact, self-referential:julia> x = SelfReferential();\n\njulia> x === x\ntrue\n\njulia> x === x.obj\ntrue\n\njulia> x === x.obj.obj\ntrueAlthough it is generally a good idea to return a fully initialized object from an inner constructor, incompletely initialized objects can be returned:julia> mutable struct Incomplete\n           xx\n           Incomplete() = new()\n       end\n\njulia> z = Incomplete();While you are allowed to create objects with uninitialized fields, any access to an uninitialized reference is an immediate error:julia> z.xx\nERROR: UndefRefError: access to undefined referenceThis avoids the need to continually check for null values. However, not all object fields are references. Julia considers some types to be \"plain data\", meaning all of their data is self-contained and does not reference other objects. The plain data types consist of primitive types (e.g. Int) and immutable structs of other plain data types. The initial contents of a plain data type is undefined:julia> struct HasPlain\n           n::Int\n           HasPlain() = new()\n       end\n\njulia> HasPlain()\nHasPlain(438103441441)Arrays of plain data types exhibit the same behavior.You can pass incomplete objects to other functions from inner constructors to delegate their completion:julia> mutable struct Lazy\n           xx\n           Lazy(v) = complete_me(new(), v)\n       endAs with incomplete objects returned from constructors, if complete_me or any of its callees try to access the xx field of the Lazy object before it has been initialized, an error will be thrown immediately."

Recall from Parametric Types that, by default, instances of parametric composite types can be constructed either with explicitly given type parameters or with type parameters implied by the types of the arguments given to the constructor.

When the type is implied by the arguments to the constructor call, as in Point(1,2), then the types of the arguments must agree – otherwise the T cannot be determined – but any pair of real arguments with matching type may be given to the generic Point constructor.What's really going on here is that Point, Point{Float64} and Point{Int64} are all different constructor functions. In fact, Point{T} is a distinct constructor function for each type T. Without any explicitly provided inner constructors, the declaration of the composite type Point{T<:Real} automatically provides an inner constructor, Point{T}, for each possible type T<:Real, that behaves just like non-parametric default inner constructors do. It also provides a single general outer Point constructor that takes pairs of real arguments, which must be of the same type. This automatic provision of constructors is equivalent to the following explicit declaration:julia> struct Point{T<:Real}\n           x::T\n           y::T\n           Point{T}(x,y) where {T<:Real} = new(x,y)\n       end\n\njulia> Point(x::T, y::T) where {T<:Real} = Point{T}(x,y);Notice that each definition looks like the form of constructor call that it handles. The call Point{Int64}(1,2) will invoke the definition Point{T}(x,y) inside the type block. The outer constructor declaration, on the other hand, defines a method for the general Point constructor which only applies to pairs of values of the same real type. This declaration makes constructor calls without explicit type parameters, like Point(1,2) and Point(1.0,2.5), work. Since the method declaration restricts the arguments to being of the same type, calls like Point(1,2.5), with arguments of different types, result in \"no method\" errors.Suppose we wanted to make the constructor call Point(1,2.5) work by \"promoting\" the integer value 1 to the floating-point value 1.0. The simplest way to achieve this is to define the following additional outer constructor method:julia> Point(x::Int64, y::Float64) = Point(convert(Float64,x),y);This method uses the convert() function to explicitly convert x to Float64 and then delegates construction to the general constructor for the case where both arguments are Float64. With this method definition what was previously a MethodError now successfully creates a point of type Point{Float64}:julia> Point(1,2.5)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 2.5)\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nPoint{Float64}However, other similar calls still don't work:julia> Point(1.5,2)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching Point(::Float64, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  Point(::T<:Real, !Matched::T<:Real) where T<:Real at none:1For a more general way to make all such calls work sensibly, see Conversion and Promotion. At the risk of spoiling the suspense, we can reveal here that all it takes is the following outer method definition to make all calls to the general Point constructor work as one would expect:julia> Point(x::Real, y::Real) = Point(promote(x,y)...);The promote function converts all its arguments to a common type – in this case Float64. With this method definition, the Point constructor promotes its arguments the same way that numeric operators like + do, and works for all kinds of real numbers:julia> Point(1.5,2)\nPoint{Float64}(1.5, 2.0)\n\njulia> Point(1,1//2)\nPoint{Rational{Int64}}(1//1, 1//2)\n\njulia> Point(1.0,1//2)\nPoint{Float64}(1.0, 0.5)Thus, while the implicit type parameter constructors provided by default in Julia are fairly strict, it is possible to make them behave in a more relaxed but sensible manner quite easily. Moreover, since constructors can leverage all of the power of the type system, methods, and multiple dispatch, defining sophisticated behavior is typically quite simple."

The field declarations num::T and den::T indicate that the data held in a OurRational{T} object are a pair of integers of type T, one representing the rational value's numerator and the other representing its denominator.Now things get interesting. OurRational has a single inner constructor method which checks that both of num and den aren't zero and ensures that every rational is constructed in \"lowest terms\" with a non-negative denominator. This is accomplished by dividing the given numerator and denominator values by their greatest common divisor, computed using the gcd function. Since gcd returns the greatest common divisor of its arguments with sign matching the first argument (den here), after this division the new value of den is guaranteed to be non-negative. Because this is the only inner constructor for OurRational, we can be certain that OurRational objects are always constructed in this normalized form.OurRational also provides several outer constructor methods for convenience. The first is the \"standard\" general constructor that infers the type parameter T from the type of the numerator and denominator when they have the same type. The second applies when the given numerator and denominator values have different types: it promotes them to a common type and then delegates construction to the outer constructor for arguments of matching type. The third outer constructor turns integer values into rationals by supplying a value of 1 as the denominator.Following the outer constructor definitions, we have a number of methods for the // operator, which provides a syntax for writing rationals. Before these definitions, // is a completely undefined operator with only syntax and no meaning. Afterwards, it behaves just as described in Rational Numbers – its entire behavior is defined in these few lines. The first and most basic definition just makes a//b construct a OurRational by applying the OurRational constructor to a and b when they are integers. When one of the operands of // is already a rational number, we construct a new rational for the resulting ratio slightly differently; this behavior is actually identical to division of a rational with an integer. Finally, applying // to complex integral values creates an instance of Complex{OurRational} – a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are rationals:julia> ans = (1 + 2im)//(1 - 2im);\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nComplex{OurRational{Int64}}\n\njulia> ans <: Complex{OurRational}\nfalseThus, although the // operator usually returns an instance of OurRational, if either of its arguments are complex integers, it will return an instance of Complex{OurRational} instead. The interested reader should consider perusing the rest of rational.jl: it is short, self-contained, and implements an entire basic Julia type."

The type of a type is Type, so all constructor methods are stored in the method table for the Type type. This means that you can declare more flexible constructors, e.g. constructors for abstract types, by explicitly defining methods for the appropriate types.However, in some cases you could consider adding methods to Base.convert instead of defining a constructor, because Julia falls back to calling convert() if no matching constructor is found. For example, if no constructor T(args...) = ... exists Base.convert(::Type{T}, args...) = ... is called.convert is used extensively throughout Julia whenever one type needs to be converted to another (e.g. in assignment, ccall, etcetera), and should generally only be defined (or successful) if the conversion is lossless.  For example, convert(Int, 3.0) produces 3, but convert(Int, 3.2) throws an InexactError.  If you want to define a constructor for a lossless conversion from one type to another, you should probably define a convert method instead.On the other hand, if your constructor does not represent a lossless conversion, or doesn't represent \"conversion\" at all, it is better to leave it as a constructor rather than a convert method. For example, the Array{Int}() constructor creates a zero-dimensional Array of the type Int, but is not really a \"conversion\" from Int to an Array."

Optionally, outer constructors that determine type parameters automatically can be added, for example constructing a Point{Int} from the call Point(1,2). Outer constructors call inner constructors to do the core work of making an instance. However, in some cases one would rather not provide inner constructors, so that specific type parameters cannot be requested manually.For example, say we define a type that stores a vector along with an accurate representation of its sum:julia> struct SummedArray{T<:Number,S<:Number}\n           data::Vector{T}\n           sum::S\n       end\n\njulia> SummedArray(Int32[1; 2; 3], Int32(6))\nSummedArray{Int32,Int32}(Int32[1, 2, 3], 6)The problem is that we want S to be a larger type than T, so that we can sum many elements with less information loss. For example, when T is Int32, we would like S to be Int64. Therefore we want to avoid an interface that allows the user to construct instances of the type SummedArray{Int32,Int32}. One way to do this is to provide a constructor only for SummedArray, but inside the type definition block to suppress generation of default constructors:julia> struct SummedArray{T<:Number,S<:Number}\n           data::Vector{T}\n           sum::S\n           function SummedArray(a::Vector{T}) where T\n               S = widen(T)\n               new{T,S}(a, sum(S, a))\n           end\n       end\n\njulia> SummedArray(Int32[1; 2; 3], Int32(6))\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching SummedArray(::Array{Int32,1}, ::Int32)\nClosest candidates are:\n  SummedArray(::Array{T,1}) where T at none:5This constructor will be invoked by the syntax SummedArray(a).

    "text": "Julia has a system for promoting arguments of mathematical operators to a common type, which has been mentioned in various other sections, including 整数と浮動小数点数, 算術処理と基本的な関数, Types, and Methods. In this section, we explain how this promotion system works, as well as how to extend it to new types and apply it to functions besides built-in mathematical operators. Traditionally, programming languages fall into two camps with respect to promotion of arithmetic arguments:Automatic promotion for built-in arithmetic types and operators. In most languages, built-in numeric types, when used as operands to arithmetic operators with infix syntax, such as +, -, *, and /, are automatically promoted to a common type to produce the expected results. C, Java, Perl, and Python, to name a few, all correctly compute the sum 1 + 1.5 as the floating-point value 2.5, even though one of the operands to + is an integer. These systems are convenient and designed carefully enough that they are generally all-but-invisible to the programmer: hardly anyone consciously thinks of this promotion taking place when writing such an expression, but compilers and interpreters must perform conversion before addition since integers and floating-point values cannot be added as-is. Complex rules for such automatic conversions are thus inevitably part of specifications and implementations for such languages.\nNo automatic promotion. This camp includes Ada and ML – very \"strict\" statically typed languages. In these languages, every conversion must be explicitly specified by the programmer. Thus, the example expression 1 + 1.5 would be a compilation error in both Ada and ML. Instead one must write real(1) + 1.5, explicitly converting the integer 1 to a floating-point value before performing addition. Explicit conversion everywhere is so inconvenient, however, that even Ada has some degree of automatic conversion: integer literals are promoted to the expected integer type automatically, and floating-point literals are similarly promoted to appropriate floating-point types.In a sense, Julia falls into the \"no automatic promotion\" category: mathematical operators are just functions with special syntax, and the arguments of functions are never automatically converted. However, one may observe that applying mathematical operations to a wide variety of mixed argument types is just an extreme case of polymorphic multiple dispatch – something which Julia's dispatch and type systems are particularly well-suited to handle. \"Automatic\" promotion of mathematical operands simply emerges as a special application: Julia comes with pre-defined catch-all dispatch rules for mathematical operators, invoked when no specific implementation exists for some combination of operand types. These catch-all rules first promote all operands to a common type using user-definable promotion rules, and then invoke a specialized implementation of the operator in question for the resulting values, now of the same type. User-defined types can easily participate in this promotion system by defining methods for conversion to and from other types, and providing a handful of promotion rules defining what types they should promote to when mixed with other types."

The third method implements a standard algorithm for approximating a floating-point number by a ratio of integers to within a given tolerance, and the fourth method applies it, using machine epsilon at the given value as the threshold. In general, one should have a//b == convert(Rational{Int64}, a/b).The last two convert methods provide conversions from rational types to floating-point and integer types. To convert to floating point, one simply converts both numerator and denominator to that floating point type and then divides. To convert to integer, one can use the div operator for truncated integer division (rounded towards zero)."

    "title": "Promotion",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Promotion refers to converting values of mixed types to a single common type. Although it is not strictly necessary, it is generally implied that the common type to which the values are converted can faithfully represent all of the original values. In this sense, the term \"promotion\" is appropriate since the values are converted to a \"greater\" type – i.e. one which can represent all of the input values in a single common type. It is important, however, not to confuse this with object-oriented (structural) super-typing, or Julia's notion of abstract super-types: promotion has nothing to do with the type hierarchy, and everything to do with converting between alternate representations. For instance, although every Int32 value can also be represented as a Float64 value, Int32 is not a subtype of Float64.Promotion to a common \"greater\" type is performed in Julia by the promote function, which takes any number of arguments, and returns a tuple of the same number of values, converted to a common type, or throws an exception if promotion is not possible. The most common use case for promotion is to convert numeric arguments to a common type:julia> promote(1, 2.5)\n(1.0, 2.5)\n\njulia> promote(1, 2.5, 3)\n(1.0, 2.5, 3.0)\n\njulia> promote(2, 3//4)\n(2//1, 3//4)\n\njulia> promote(1, 2.5, 3, 3//4)\n(1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 0.75)\n\njulia> promote(1.5, im)\n(1.5 + 0.0im, 0.0 + 1.0im)\n\njulia> promote(1 + 2im, 3//4)\n(1//1 + 2//1*im, 3//4 + 0//1*im)Floating-point values are promoted to the largest of the floating-point argument types. Integer values are promoted to the larger of either the native machine word size or the largest integer argument type. Mixtures of integers and floating-point values are promoted to a floating-point type big enough to hold all the values. Integers mixed with rationals are promoted to rationals. Rationals mixed with floats are promoted to floats. Complex values mixed with real values are promoted to the appropriate kind of complex value.That is really all there is to using promotions. The rest is just a matter of clever application, the most typical \"clever\" application being the definition of catch-all methods for numeric operations like the arithmetic operators +, -, * and /. Here are some of the catch-all method definitions given in promotion.jl:+(x::Number, y::Number) = +(promote(x,y)...)\n-(x::Number, y::Number) = -(promote(x,y)...)\n*(x::Number, y::Number) = *(promote(x,y)...)\n/(x::Number, y::Number) = /(promote(x,y)...)These method definitions say that in the absence of more specific rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing pairs of numeric values, promote the values to a common type and then try again. That's all there is to it: nowhere else does one ever need to worry about promotion to a common numeric type for arithmetic operations – it just happens automatically. There are definitions of catch-all promotion methods for a number of other arithmetic and mathematical functions in promotion.jl, but beyond that, there are hardly any calls to promote required in the Julia standard library. The most common usages of promote occur in outer constructors methods, provided for convenience, to allow constructor calls with mixed types to delegate to an inner type with fields promoted to an appropriate common type. For example, recall that rational.jl provides the following outer constructor method:Rational(n::Integer, d::Integer) = Rational(promote(n,d)...)This allows calls like the following to work:julia> Rational(Int8(15),Int32(-5))\n-3//1\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nRational{Int32}For most user-defined types, it is better practice to require programmers to supply the expected types to constructor functions explicitly, but sometimes, especially for numeric problems, it can be convenient to do promotion automatically."

    "title": "Defining Promotion Rules",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Although one could, in principle, define methods for the promote function directly, this would require many redundant definitions for all possible permutations of argument types. Instead, the behavior of promote is defined in terms of an auxiliary function called promote_rule, which one can provide methods for. The promote_rule function takes a pair of type objects and returns another type object, such that instances of the argument types will be promoted to the returned type. Thus, by defining the rule:promote_rule(::Type{Float64}, ::Type{Float32}) = Float64one declares that when 64-bit and 32-bit floating-point values are promoted together, they should be promoted to 64-bit floating-point. The promotion type does not need to be one of the argument types, however; the following promotion rules both occur in Julia's standard library:promote_rule(::Type{UInt8}, ::Type{Int8}) = Int\npromote_rule(::Type{BigInt}, ::Type{Int8}) = BigIntIn the latter case, the result type is BigInt since BigInt is the only type large enough to hold integers for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.  Also note that one does not need to define both promote_rule(::Type{A}, ::Type{B}) and promote_rule(::Type{B}, ::Type{A}) – the symmetry is implied by the way promote_rule is used in the promotion process.The promote_rule function is used as a building block to define a second function called promote_type, which, given any number of type objects, returns the common type to which those values, as arguments to promote should be promoted. Thus, if one wants to know, in absence of actual values, what type a collection of values of certain types would promote to, one can use promote_type:julia> promote_type(Int8, UInt16)\nInt64Internally, promote_type is used inside of promote to determine what type argument values should be converted to for promotion. It can, however, be useful in its own right. The curious reader can read the code in promotion.jl, which defines the complete promotion mechanism in about 35 lines."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Finally, we finish off our ongoing case study of Julia's rational number type, which makes relatively sophisticated use of the promotion mechanism with the following promotion rules:promote_rule(::Type{Rational{T}}, ::Type{S}) where {T<:Integer,S<:Integer} = Rational{promote_type(T,S)}\npromote_rule(::Type{Rational{T}}, ::Type{Rational{S}}) where {T<:Integer,S<:Integer} = Rational{promote_type(T,S)}\npromote_rule(::Type{Rational{T}}, ::Type{S}) where {T<:Integer,S<:AbstractFloat} = promote_type(T,S)The first rule says that promoting a rational number with any other integer type promotes to a rational type whose numerator/denominator type is the result of promotion of its numerator/denominator type with the other integer type. The second rule applies the same logic to two different types of rational numbers, resulting in a rational of the promotion of their respective numerator/denominator types. The third and final rule dictates that promoting a rational with a float results in the same type as promoting the numerator/denominator type with the float.This small handful of promotion rules, together with the conversion methods discussed above, are sufficient to make rational numbers interoperate completely naturally with all of Julia's other numeric types – integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. By providing appropriate conversion methods and promotion rules in the same manner, any user-defined numeric type can interoperate just as naturally with Julia's predefined numerics."

Instead of mutating objects as they are iterated over, Julia provides these three methods to keep track of the iteration state externally from the object. The start(iter) method returns the initial state for the iterable object iter. That state gets passed along to done(iter, state), which tests if there are any elements remaining, and next(iter, state), which returns a tuple containing the current element and an updated state. The state object can be anything, and is generally considered to be an implementation detail private to the iterable object.Any object defines these three methods is iterable and can be used in the many functions that rely upon iteration. It can also be used directly in a for loop since the syntax:for i in iter   # or  \"for i = iter\"\n    # body\nendis translated into:state = start(iter)\nwhile !done(iter, state)\n    (i, state) = next(iter, state)\n    # body\nendA simple example is an iterable sequence of square numbers with a defined length:julia> struct Squares\n           count::Int\n       end\n\njulia> Base.start(::Squares) = 1\n\njulia> Base.next(S::Squares, state) = (state*state, state+1)\n\njulia> Base.done(S::Squares, state) = state > S.count\n\njulia> Base.eltype(::Type{Squares}) = Int # Note that this is defined for the type\n\njulia> Base.length(S::Squares) = S.countWith only start, next, and done definitions, the Squares type is already pretty powerful.

We know that the elements in a Squares sequence will always be Int. By extending the eltype() method, we can give that information to Julia and help it make more specialized code in the more complicated methods. We also know the number of elements in our sequence, so we can extend length(), too.Now, when we ask Julia to collect() all the elements into an array it can preallocate a Vector{Int} of the right size instead of blindly push!ing each element into a Vector{Any}:julia> collect(Squares(10))' # transposed to save space\n1×10 RowVector{Int64,Array{Int64,1}}:\n 1  4  9  16  25  36  49  64  81  100While we can rely upon generic implementations, we can also extend specific methods where we know there is a simpler algorithm. For example, there's a formula to compute the sum of squares, so we can override the generic iterative version with a more performant solution:julia> Base.sum(S::Squares) = (n = S.count; return n*(n+1)*(2n+1)÷6)\n\njulia> sum(Squares(1803))\n1955361914This is a very common pattern throughout the Julia standard library: a small set of required methods define an informal interface that enable many fancier behaviors. In some cases, types will want to additionally specialize those extra behaviors when they know a more efficient algorithm can be used in their specific case."

See the arrays manual page and standard library section for more supported methods.A key part in defining an AbstractArray subtype is IndexStyle. Since indexing is such an important part of an array and often occurs in hot loops, it's important to make both indexing and indexed assignment as efficient as possible.  Array data structures are typically defined in one of two ways: either it most efficiently accesses its elements using just one index (linear indexing) or it intrinsically accesses the elements with indices specified for every dimension.  These two modalities are identified by Julia as IndexLinear() and IndexCartesian().  Converting a linear index to multiple indexing subscripts is typically very expensive, so this provides a traits-based mechanism to enable efficient generic code for all array types.This distinction determines which scalar indexing methods the type must define. IndexLinear() arrays are simple: just define getindex(A::ArrayType, i::Int).  When the array is subsequently indexed with a multidimensional set of indices, the fallback getindex(A::AbstractArray, I...)() efficiently converts the indices into one linear index and then calls the above method. IndexCartesian() arrays, on the other hand, require methods to be defined for each supported dimensionality with ndims(A)Int indices.  For example, the builtin SparseMatrixCSC type only supports two dimensions, so it just defines getindex(A::SparseMatrixCSC, i::Int, j::Int)().  The same holds for setindex!().Returning to the sequence of squares from above, we could instead define it as a subtype of an AbstractArray{Int, 1}:julia> struct SquaresVector <: AbstractArray{Int, 1}\n           count::Int\n       end\n\njulia> Base.size(S::SquaresVector) = (S.count,)\n\njulia> Base.IndexStyle(::Type{<:SquaresVector}) = IndexLinear()\n\njulia> Base.getindex(S::SquaresVector, i::Int) = i*iNote that it's very important to specify the two parameters of the AbstractArray; the first defines the eltype(), and the second defines the ndims(). That supertype and those three methods are all it takes for SquaresVector to be an iterable, indexable, and completely functional array:julia> s = SquaresVector(7)\n7-element SquaresVector:\n  1\n  4\n  9\n 16\n 25\n 36\n 49\n\njulia> s[s .> 20]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 25\n 36\n 49\n\njulia> s \\ [1 2; 3 4; 5 6; 7 8; 9 10; 11 12; 13 14]\n1×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.305389  0.335329\n\njulia> s ⋅ s # dot(s, s)\n4676As a more complicated example, let's define our own toy N-dimensional sparse-like array type built on top of Dict:julia> struct SparseArray{T,N} <: AbstractArray{T,N}\n           data::Dict{NTuple{N,Int}, T}\n           dims::NTuple{N,Int}\n       end\n\njulia> SparseArray{T}(::Type{T}, dims::Int...) = SparseArray(T, dims);\n\njulia> SparseArray{T,N}(::Type{T}, dims::NTuple{N,Int}) = SparseArray{T,N}(Dict{NTuple{N,Int}, T}(), dims);\n\njulia> Base.size(A::SparseArray) = A.dims\n\njulia> Base.similar(A::SparseArray, ::Type{T}, dims::Dims) where {T} = SparseArray(T, dims)\n\njulia> Base.getindex(A::SparseArray{T,N}, I::Vararg{Int,N}) where {T,N} = get(A.data, I, zero(T))\n\njulia> Base.setindex!(A::SparseArray{T,N}, v, I::Vararg{Int,N}) where {T,N} = (A.data[I] = v)Notice that this is an IndexCartesian array, so we must manually define getindex() and setindex!() at the dimensionality of the array. Unlike the SquaresVector, we are able to define setindex!(), and so we can mutate the array:julia> A = SparseArray(Float64, 3, 3)\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0\n\njulia> fill!(A, 2)\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 2.0  2.0  2.0\n 2.0  2.0  2.0\n 2.0  2.0  2.0\n\njulia> A[:] = 1:length(A); A\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  4.0  7.0\n 2.0  5.0  8.0\n 3.0  6.0  9.0The result of indexing an AbstractArray can itself be an array (for instance when indexing by a Range). The AbstractArray fallback methods use similar() to allocate an Array of the appropriate size and element type, which is filled in using the basic indexing method described above. However, when implementing an array wrapper you often want the result to be wrapped as well:julia> A[1:2,:]\n2×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  4.0  7.0\n 2.0  5.0  8.0In this example it is accomplished by defining Base.similar{T}(A::SparseArray, ::Type{T}, dims::Dims) to create the appropriate wrapped array. (Note that while similar supports 1- and 2-argument forms, in most case you only need to specialize the 3-argument form.) For this to work it's important that SparseArray is mutable (supports setindex!). Defining similar(), getindex() and setindex!() for SparseArray also makes it possible to copy() the array:julia> copy(A)\n3×3 SparseArray{Float64,2}:\n 1.0  4.0  7.0\n 2.0  5.0  8.0\n 3.0  6.0  9.0In addition to all the iterable and indexable methods from above, these types can also interact with each other and use most of the methods defined in the standard library for AbstractArrays:julia> A[SquaresVector(3)]\n3-element SparseArray{Float64,1}:\n 1.0\n 4.0\n 9.0\n\njulia> dot(A[:,1],A[:,2])\n32.0If you are defining an array type that allows non-traditional indexing (indices that start at something other than 1), you should specialize indices. You should also specialize similar so that the dims argument (ordinarily a Dims size-tuple) can accept AbstractUnitRange objects, perhaps range-types Ind of your own design. For more information, see Arrays with custom indices."

Modules allow you to create top-level definitions (aka global variables) without worrying about name conflicts when your code is used together with somebody else's. Within a module, you can control which names from other modules are visible (via importing), and specify which of your names are intended to be public (via exporting).The following example demonstrates the major features of modules. It is not meant to be run, but is shown for illustrative purposes:module MyModule\nusing Lib\n\nusing BigLib: thing1, thing2\n\nimport Base.show\n\nimportall OtherLib\n\nexport MyType, foo\n\nstruct MyType\n    x\nend\n\nbar(x) = 2x\nfoo(a::MyType) = bar(a.x) + 1\n\nshow(io::IO, a::MyType) = print(io, \"MyType $(a.x)\")\nendNote that the style is not to indent the body of the module, since that would typically lead to whole files being indented.This module defines a type MyType, and two functions. Function foo and type MyType are exported, and so will be available for importing into other modules.  Function bar is private to MyModule.The statement using Lib means that a module called Lib will be available for resolving names as needed. When a global variable is encountered that has no definition in the current module, the system will search for it among variables exported by Lib and import it if it is found there. This means that all uses of that global within the current module will resolve to the definition of that variable in Lib.The statement using BigLib: thing1, thing2 is a syntactic shortcut for using BigLib.thing1, BigLib.thing2.The import keyword supports all the same syntax as using, but only operates on a single name at a time. It does not add modules to be searched the way using does. import also differs from using in that functions must be imported using import to be extended with new methods.In MyModule above we wanted to add a method to the standard show function, so we had to write import Base.show. Functions whose names are only visible via using cannot be extended.The keyword importall explicitly imports all names exported by the specified module, as if import were individually used on all of them.Once a variable is made visible via using or import, a module may not create its own variable with the same name. Imported variables are read-only; assigning to a global variable always affects a variable owned by the current module, or else raises an error."

If the module does not exist, the system attempts to require(\"Foo\"), which typically results in loading code from an installed package.However, some modules contain submodules, which means you sometimes need to access a module that is not directly available in Main. There are two ways to do this. The first is to use an absolute path, for example using Base.Sort. The second is to use a relative path, which makes it easier to import submodules of the current module or any of its enclosing modules:module Parent\n\nmodule Utils\n...\nend\n\nusing .Utils\n\n...\nendHere module Parent contains a submodule Utils, and code in Parent wants the contents of Utils to be visible. This is done by starting the using path with a period. Adding more leading periods moves up additional levels in the module hierarchy. For example using ..Utils would look for Utils in Parent's enclosing module rather than in Parent itself.Note that relative-import qualifiers are only valid in using and import statements."

It can also have methods added to it by using the qualified name as the function name. However, due to syntactic ambiguities that arise, if you wish to add methods to a function in a different module whose name contains only symbols, such as an operator, Base.+ for example, you must use Base.:+ to refer to it. If the operator is more than one character in length you must surround it in brackets, such as: Base.:(==).Macro names are written with @ in import and export statements, e.g. import Mod.@mac. Macros in other modules can be invoked as Mod.@mac or @Mod.mac.The syntax M.x = y does not work to assign a global in another module; global assignment is always module-local.A variable can be \"reserved\" for the current module without assigning to it by declaring it as global x at the top level.

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Large modules can take several seconds to load because executing all of the statements in a module often involves compiling a large amount of code. Julia provides the ability to create precompiled versions of modules to reduce this time.To create an incremental precompiled module file, add __precompile__() at the top of your module file (before the module starts). This will cause it to be automatically compiled the first time it is imported. Alternatively, you can manually call Base.compilecache(modulename). The resulting cache files will be stored in Base.LOAD_CACHE_PATH[1]. Subsequently, the module is automatically recompiled upon import whenever any of its dependencies change; dependencies are modules it imports, the Julia build, files it includes, or explicit dependencies declared by include_dependency(path) in the module file(s).For file dependencies, a change is determined by examining whether the modification time (mtime) of each file loaded by include or added explicitly by include_dependency is unchanged, or equal to the modification time truncated to the nearest second (to accommodate systems that can't copy mtime with sub-second accuracy). It also takes into account whether the path to the file chosen by the search logic in require matches the path that had created the precompile file.It also takes into account the set of dependencies already loaded into the current process and won't recompile those modules, even if their files change or disappear, in order to avoid creating incompatibilities between the running system and the precompile cache. If you want to have changes to the source reflected in the running system, you should call reload(\"Module\") on the module you changed, and any module that depended on it in which you want to see the change reflected.Precompiling a module also recursively precompiles any modules that are imported therein. If you know that it is not safe to precompile your module (for the reasons described below), you should put __precompile__(false) in the module file to cause Base.compilecache to throw an error (and thereby prevent the module from being imported by any other precompiled module).__precompile__() should not be used in a module unless all of its dependencies are also using __precompile__(). Failure to do so can result in a runtime error when loading the module.In order to make your module work with precompilation, however, you may need to change your module to explicitly separate any initialization steps that must occur at runtime from steps that can occur at compile time.  For this purpose, Julia allows you to define an __init__() function in your module that executes any initialization steps that must occur at runtime. This function will not be called during compilation (--output-* or __precompile__()). You may, of course, call it manually if necessary, but the default is to assume this function deals with computing state for the local machine, which does not need to be – or even should not be – captured in the compiled image. It will be called after the module is loaded into a process, including if it is being loaded into an incremental compile (--output-incremental=yes), but not if it is being loaded into a full-compilation process.In particular, if you define a function __init__() in a module, then Julia will call __init__() immediately after the module is loaded (e.g., by import, using, or require) at runtime for the first time (i.e., __init__ is only called once, and only after all statements in the module have been executed). Because it is called after the module is fully imported, any submodules or other imported modules have their __init__ functions called before the __init__ of the enclosing module.Two typical uses of __init__ are calling runtime initialization functions of external C libraries and initializing global constants that involve pointers returned by external libraries.  For example, suppose that we are calling a C library libfoo that requires us to call a foo_init() initialization function at runtime. Suppose that we also want to define a global constant foo_data_ptr that holds the return value of a void *foo_data() function defined by libfoo – this constant must be initialized at runtime (not at compile time) because the pointer address will change from run to run.  You could accomplish this by defining the following __init__ function in your module:const foo_data_ptr = Ref{Ptr{Void}}(0)\nfunction __init__()\n    ccall((:foo_init, :libfoo), Void, ())\n    foo_data_ptr[] = ccall((:foo_data, :libfoo), Ptr{Void}, ())\nendNotice that it is perfectly possible to define a global inside a function like __init__; this is one of the advantages of using a dynamic language. But by making it a constant at global scope, we can ensure that the type is known to the compiler and allow it to generate better optimized code. Obviously, any other globals in your module that depends on foo_data_ptr would also have to be initialized in __init__.Constants involving most Julia objects that are not produced by ccall do not need to be placed in __init__: their definitions can be precompiled and loaded from the cached module image. This includes complicated heap-allocated objects like arrays. However, any routine that returns a raw pointer value must be called at runtime for precompilation to work (Ptr objects will turn into null pointers unless they are hidden inside an isbits object). This includes the return values of the Julia functions cfunction and pointer.Dictionary and set types, or in general anything that depends on the output of a hash(key) method, are a trickier case.  In the common case where the keys are numbers, strings, symbols, ranges, Expr, or compositions of these types (via arrays, tuples, sets, pairs, etc.) they are safe to precompile.  However, for a few other key types, such as Function or DataType and generic user-defined types where you haven't defined a hash method, the fallback hash method depends on the memory address of the object (via its object_id) and hence may change from run to run. If you have one of these key types, or if you aren't sure, to be safe you can initialize this dictionary from within your __init__ function. Alternatively, you can use the ObjectIdDict dictionary type, which is specially handled by precompilation so that it is safe to initialize at compile-time.When using precompilation, it is important to keep a clear sense of the distinction between the compilation phase and the execution phase. In this mode, it will often be much more clearly apparent that Julia is a compiler which allows execution of arbitrary Julia code, not a standalone interpreter that also generates compiled code.Other known potential failure scenarios include:Global counters (for example, for attempting to uniquely identify objects) Consider the following code snippet:\nmutable struct UniquedById\n    myid::Int\n    let counter = 0\n        UniquedById() = new(counter += 1)\n    end\nend\nwhile the intent of this code was to give every instance a unique id, the counter value is recorded at the end of compilation. All subsequent usages of this incrementally compiled module will start from that same counter value.\nNote that object_id (which works by hashing the memory pointer) has similar issues (see notes on Dict usage below).\nOne alternative is to store both current_module() and the current counter value, however, it may be better to redesign the code to not depend on this global state.\nAssociative collections (such as Dict and Set) need to be re-hashed in __init__. (In the future, a mechanism may be provided to register an initializer function.)\nDepending on compile-time side-effects persisting through load-time. Example include: modifying arrays or other variables in other Julia modules; maintaining handles to open files or devices; storing pointers to other system resources (including memory);\nCreating accidental \"copies\" of global state from another module, by referencing it directly instead of via its lookup path. For example, (in global scope):\n#mystdout = Base.STDOUT #= will not work correctly, since this will copy Base.STDOUT into this module =#\n# instead use accessor functions:\ngetstdout() = Base.STDOUT #= best option =#\n# or move the assignment into the runtime:\n__init__() = global mystdout = Base.STDOUT #= also works =#Several additional restrictions are placed on the operations that can be done while precompiling code to help the user avoid other wrong-behavior situations:Calling eval to cause a side-effect in another module. This will also cause a warning to be emitted when the incremental precompile flag is set.\nglobal const statements from local scope after __init__() has been started (see issue #12010 for plans to add an error for this)\nReplacing a module (or calling workspace()) is a runtime error while doing an incremental precompile.A few other points to be aware of:No code reload / cache invalidation is performed after changes are made to the source files themselves, (including by Pkg.update), and no cleanup is done after Pkg.rm\nThe memory sharing behavior of a reshaped array is disregarded by precompilation (each view gets its own copy)\nExpecting the filesystem to be unchanged between compile-time and runtime e.g. @__FILE__/source_path() to find resources at runtime, or the BinDeps @checked_lib macro. Sometimes this is unavoidable. However, when possible, it can be good practice to copy resources into the module at compile-time so they won't need to be found at runtime.\nWeakRef objects and finalizers are not currently handled properly by the serializer (this will be fixed in an upcoming release).\nIt is usually best to avoid capturing references to instances of internal metadata objects such as Method, MethodInstance, MethodTable, TypeMapLevel, TypeMapEntry and fields of those objects, as this can confuse the serializer and may not lead to the outcome you desire. It is not necessarily an error to do this, but you simply need to be prepared that the system will try to copy some of these and to create a single unique instance of others.It is sometimes helpful during module development to turn off incremental precompilation. The command line flag --compilecache={yes|no} enables you to toggle module precompilation on and off. When Julia is started with --compilecache=no the serialized modules in the compile cache are ignored when loading modules and module dependencies. Base.compilecache() can still be called manually and it will respect __precompile__() directives for the module. The state of this command line flag is passed to Pkg.build() to disable automatic precompilation triggering when installing, updating, and explicitly building packages."

    "text": "Julia enables package developers and users to document functions, types and other objects easily via a built-in documentation system since Julia 0.4.The basic syntax is very simple: any string appearing at the top-level right before an object (function, macro, type or instance) will be interpreted as documenting it (these are called docstrings). Here is a very simple example:\"Tell whether there are too foo items in the array.\"\nfoo(xs::Array) = ...Documentation is interpreted as Markdown, so you can use indentation and code fences to delimit code examples from text. Technically, any object can be associated with any other as metadata; Markdown happens to be the default, but one can construct other string macros and pass them to the @doc macro just as well.Here is a more complex example, still using Markdown:\"\"\"\n    bar(x[, y])\n\nCompute the Bar index between `x` and `y`. If `y` is missing, compute\nthe Bar index between all pairs of columns of `x`.\n\n# Examples\n```julia-repl\njulia> bar([1, 2], [1, 2])\n1\n```\n\"\"\"\nfunction bar(x, y) ...As in the example above, we recommend following some simple conventions when writing documentation:Always show the signature of a function at the top of the documentation, with a four-space indent so that it is printed as Julia code.\nThis can be identical to the signature present in the Julia code (like mean(x::AbstractArray)), or a simplified form. Optional arguments should be represented with their default values (i.e. f(x, y=1)) when possible, following the actual Julia syntax. Optional arguments which do not have a default value should be put in brackets (i.e. f(x[, y]) and f(x[, y[, z]])). An alternative solution is to use several lines: one without optional arguments, the other(s) with them. This solution can also be used to document several related methods of a given function. When a function accepts many keyword arguments, only include a <keyword arguments> placeholder in the signature (i.e. f(x; <keyword arguments>)), and give the complete list under an # Arguments section (see point 4 below).\nInclude a single one-line sentence describing what the function does or what the object represents after the simplified signature block. If needed, provide more details in a second paragraph, after a blank line.\nThe one-line sentence should use the imperative form (\"Do this\", \"Return that\") instead of the third person (do not write \"Returns the length...\") when documenting functions. It should end with a period. If the meaning of a function cannot be summarized easily, splitting it into separate composable parts could be beneficial (this should not be taken as an absolute requirement for every single case though).\nDo not repeat yourself.\nSince the function name is given by the signature, there is no need to start the documentation with \"The function bar...\": go straight to the point. Similarly, if the signature specifies the types of the arguments, mentioning them in the description is redundant.\nOnly provide an argument list when really necessary.\nFor simple functions, it is often clearer to mention the role of the arguments directly in the description of the function's purpose. An argument list would only repeat information already provided elsewhere. However, providing an argument list can be a good idea for complex functions with many arguments (in particular keyword arguments). In that case, insert it after the general description of the function, under an # Arguments header, with one - bullet for each argument. The list should mention the types and default values (if any) of the arguments:\n\"\"\"\n...\n# Arguments\n- `n::Integer`: the number of elements to compute.\n- `dim::Integer=1`: the dimensions along which to perform the computation.\n...\n\"\"\"\nInclude any code examples in an # Examples section.\nExamples should, whenever possible, be written as doctests. A doctest is a fenced code block (see Code blocks) starting with ```jldoctest and contains any number of julia> prompts together with inputs and expected outputs that mimic the Julia REPL.\nFor example in the following docstring a variable a is defined and the expected result, as printed in a Julia REPL, appears afterwards:\n\"\"\"\nSome nice documentation here.\n\n# Examples\n\n```jldoctest\njulia> a = [1 2; 3 4]\n2×2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  2\n 3  4\n```\n\"\"\"\nwarning: Warning\nCalling rand and other RNG-related functions should be avoided in doctests since they will not produce consistent outputs during different Julia sessions.Operating system word size (Int32 or Int64) as well as path separator differences (/ or \\) will also effect the reproducibility of some doctests.Note that whitespace in your doctest is significant! The doctest will fail if you misalign the output of pretty-printing an array, for example.\nYou can then run make -C doc doctest to run all the doctests in the Julia Manual, which will ensure that your example works.\nExamples that are untestable should be written within fenced code blocks starting with ```julia so that they are highlighted correctly in the generated documentation.\ntip: Tip\nWherever possible examples should be self-contained and runnable so that readers are able to try them out without having to include any dependencies.\nUse backticks to identify code and equations.\nJulia identifiers and code excerpts should always appear between backticks ` to enable highlighting. Equations in the LaTeX syntax can be inserted between double backticks ``. Use Unicode characters rather than their LaTeX escape sequence, i.e. ``α = 1`` rather than ``\\\\alpha = 1``.\nPlace the starting and ending \"\"\" characters on lines by themselves.\nThat is, write:\n\"\"\"\n...\n\n...\n\"\"\"\nf(x, y) = ...\nrather than:\n\"\"\"...\n\n...\"\"\"\nf(x, y) = ...\nThis makes it more clear where docstrings start and end.\nRespect the line length limit used in the surrounding code.\nDocstrings are edited using the same tools as code. Therefore, the same conventions should apply. It it advised to add line breaks after 92 characters."

This allows sophisticated code generation without extra build steps, and also allows true Lisp-style macros operating at the level of abstract syntax trees. In contrast, preprocessor \"macro\" systems, like that of C and C++, perform textual manipulation and substitution before any actual parsing or interpretation occurs. Because all data types and code in Julia are represented by Julia data structures, powerful reflection capabilities are available to explore the internals of a program and its types just like any other data."

Note the important distinction between the way a and b are used:The value of the variablea at expression construction time is used as an immediate value in the expression. Thus, the value of a when the expression is evaluated no longer matters: the value in the expression is already 1, independent of whatever the value of a might be.\nOn the other hand, the symbol:b is used in the expression construction, so the value of the variable b at that time is irrelevant – :b is just a symbol and the variable b need not even be defined. At expression evaluation time, however, the value of the symbol :b is resolved by looking up the value of the variable b."

One way to explore macro arguments is to call the show() function within the macro body:julia> macro showarg(x)\n           show(x)\n           # ... remainder of macro, returning an expression\n       end\n@showarg (macro with 1 method)\n\njulia> @showarg(a)\n:a\n\njulia> @showarg(1+1)\n:(1 + 1)\n\njulia> @showarg(println(\"Yo!\"))\n:(println(\"Yo!\"))In addition to the given argument list, every macro is passed an extra argument named __source__ providing information (in the form of a LineNumberNode object) about the parser location of the @ sign from the macro invocation.This allows macros to include better error diagnostic information, and is commonly used by logging, string-parser macros, and docs, for example, as well as to implement the @__LINE__, @__FILE__, and @__DIR__ macros.The location information can be accessed by referencing __source__.line and __source__.file:julia> macro __LOCATION__(); return QuoteNode(__source__); end\n\njulia> dump(\n            @__LOCATION__(\n       ))\nLineNumberNode\n  line: Int64 2\n  file: Symbol REPL[2]"

    "text": "Here is a simplified definition of Julia's @assert macro:julia> macro assert(ex)\n           return :( $ex ? nothing : throw(AssertionError($(string(ex)))) )\n       end\n@assert (macro with 1 method)This macro can be used like this:julia> @assert 1 == 1.0\n\njulia> @assert 1 == 0\nERROR: AssertionError: 1 == 0In place of the written syntax, the macro call is expanded at parse time to its returned result. This is equivalent to writing:1 == 1.0 ? nothing : throw(AssertionError(\"1 == 1.0\"))\n1 == 0 ? nothing : throw(AssertionError(\"1 == 0\"))That is, in the first call, the expression :(1 == 1.0) is spliced into the test condition slot, while the value of string(:(1 == 1.0)) is spliced into the assertion message slot. The entire expression, thus constructed, is placed into the syntax tree where the @assert macro call occurs. Then at execution time, if the test expression evaluates to true, then nothing is returned, whereas if the test is false, an error is raised indicating the asserted expression that was false. Notice that it would not be possible to write this as a function, since only the value of the condition is available and it would be impossible to display the expression that computed it in the error message.The actual definition of @assert in the standard library is more complicated. It allows the user to optionally specify their own error message, instead of just printing the failed expression. Just like in functions with a variable number of arguments, this is specified with an ellipses following the last argument:julia> macro assert(ex, msgs...)\n           msg_body = isempty(msgs) ? ex : msgs[1]\n           msg = string(msg_body)\n           return :($ex ? nothing : throw(AssertionError($msg)))\n       end\n@assert (macro with 1 method)Now @assert has two modes of operation, depending upon the number of arguments it receives! If there's only one argument, the tuple of expressions captured by msgs will be empty and it will behave the same as the simpler definition above. But now if the user specifies a second argument, it is printed in the message body instead of the failing expression. You can inspect the result of a macro expansion with the aptly named macroexpand() function:julia> macroexpand(:(@assert a == b))\n:(if a == b\n        nothing\n    else\n        (throw)((AssertionError)(\"a == b\"))\n    end)\n\njulia> macroexpand(:(@assert a==b \"a should equal b!\"))\n:(if a == b\n        nothing\n    else\n        (throw)((AssertionError)(\"a should equal b!\"))\n    end)There is yet another case that the actual @assert macro handles: what if, in addition to printing \"a should equal b,\" we wanted to print their values? One might naively try to use string interpolation in the custom message, e.g., @assert a==b \"a ($a) should equal b ($b)!\", but this won't work as expected with the above macro. Can you see why? Recall from string interpolation that an interpolated string is rewritten to a call to string(). Compare:julia> typeof(:(\"a should equal b\"))\nString\n\njulia> typeof(:(\"a ($a) should equal b ($b)!\"))\nExpr\n\njulia> dump(:(\"a ($a) should equal b ($b)!\"))\nExpr\n  head: Symbol string\n  args: Array{Any}((5,))\n    1: String \"a (\"\n    2: Symbol a\n    3: String \") should equal b (\"\n    4: Symbol b\n    5: String \")!\"\n  typ: AnySo now instead of getting a plain string in msg_body, the macro is receiving a full expression that will need to be evaluated in order to display as expected. This can be spliced directly into the returned expression as an argument to the string() call; see error.jl for the complete implementation.The @assert macro makes great use of splicing into quoted expressions to simplify the manipulation of expressions inside the macro body."

    "page": "Metaprogramming",
    "title": "Hygiene",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "An issue that arises in more complex macros is that of hygiene. In short, macros must ensure that the variables they introduce in their returned expressions do not accidentally clash with existing variables in the surrounding code they expand into. Conversely, the expressions that are passed into a macro as arguments are often expected to evaluate in the context of the surrounding code, interacting with and modifying the existing variables. Another concern arises from the fact that a macro may be called in a different module from where it was defined. In this case we need to ensure that all global variables are resolved to the correct module. Julia already has a major advantage over languages with textual macro expansion (like C) in that it only needs to consider the returned expression. All the other variables (such as msg in @assert above) follow the normal scoping block behavior.To demonstrate these issues, let us consider writing a @time macro that takes an expression as its argument, records the time, evaluates the expression, records the time again, prints the difference between the before and after times, and then has the value of the expression as its final value. The macro might look like this:macro time(ex)\n    return quote\n        local t0 = time()\n        local val = $ex\n        local t1 = time()\n        println(\"elapsed time: \", t1-t0, \" seconds\")\n        val\n    end\nendHere, we want t0, t1, and val to be private temporary variables, and we want time to refer to the time() function in the standard library, not to any time variable the user might have (the same applies to println). Imagine the problems that could occur if the user expression ex also contained assignments to a variable called t0, or defined its own time variable. We might get errors, or mysteriously incorrect behavior.Julia's macro expander solves these problems in the following way. First, variables within a macro result are classified as either local or global. A variable is considered local if it is assigned to (and not declared global), declared local, or used as a function argument name. Otherwise, it is considered global. Local variables are then renamed to be unique (using the gensym() function, which generates new symbols), and global variables are resolved within the macro definition environment. Therefore both of the above concerns are handled; the macro's locals will not conflict with any user variables, and time and println will refer to the standard library definitions.One problem remains however. Consider the following use of this macro:module MyModule\nimport Base.@time\n\ntime() = ... # compute something\n\n@time time()\nendHere the user expression ex is a call to time, but not the same time function that the macro uses. It clearly refers to MyModule.time. Therefore we must arrange for the code in ex to be resolved in the macro call environment. This is done by \"escaping\" the expression with esc():macro time(ex)\n    ...\n    local val = $(esc(ex))\n    ...\nendAn expression wrapped in this manner is left alone by the macro expander and simply pasted into the output verbatim. Therefore it will be resolved in the macro call environment.This escaping mechanism can be used to \"violate\" hygiene when necessary, in order to introduce or manipulate user variables. For example, the following macro sets x to zero in the call environment:julia> macro zerox()\n           return esc(:(x = 0))\n       end\n@zerox (macro with 1 method)\n\njulia> function foo()\n           x = 1\n           @zerox\n           return x # is zero\n       end\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo()\n0This kind of manipulation of variables should be used judiciously, but is occasionally quite handy.Getting the hygiene rules correct can be a formidable challenge. Before using a macro, you might want to consider whether a function closure would be sufficient. Another useful strategy is to defer as much work as possible to runtime. For example, many macros simply wrap their arguments in a QuoteNode or other similar Expr. Some examples of this include @task body which simply returns schedule(Task(() -> $body)), and @eval expr, which simply returns eval(QuoteNode(expr)).To demonstrate, we might rewrite the @time example above as:macro time(expr)\n    return :(timeit(() -> $(esc(expr))))\nend\nfunction timeit(f)\n    t0 = time()\n    val = f()\n    t1 = time()\n    println(\"elapsed time: \", t1-t0, \" seconds\")\n    return val\nendHowever, we don't do this for a good reason: wrapping the expr in a new scope block (the anonymous function) also slightly changes the meaning of the expression (the scope of any variables in it), while we want @time to be usable with minimum impact on the wrapped code."

    "text": "When a significant amount of repetitive boilerplate code is required, it is common to generate it programmatically to avoid redundancy. In most languages, this requires an extra build step, and a separate program to generate the repetitive code. In Julia, expression interpolation and eval() allow such code generation to take place in the normal course of program execution. For example, the following code defines a series of operators on three arguments in terms of their 2-argument forms:for op = (:+, :*, :&, :|, :$)\n    eval(quote\n        ($op)(a,b,c) = ($op)(($op)(a,b),c)\n    end)\nendIn this manner, Julia acts as its own preprocessor, and allows code generation from inside the language. The above code could be written slightly more tersely using the : prefix quoting form:for op = (:+, :*, :&, :|, :$)\n    eval(:(($op)(a,b,c) = ($op)(($op)(a,b),c)))\nendThis sort of in-language code generation, however, using the eval(quote(...)) pattern, is common enough that Julia comes with a macro to abbreviate this pattern:for op = (:+, :*, :&, :|, :$)\n    @eval ($op)(a,b,c) = ($op)(($op)(a,b),c)\nendThe @eval macro rewrites this call to be precisely equivalent to the above longer versions. For longer blocks of generated code, the expression argument given to @eval can be a block:@eval begin\n    # multiple lines\nend"

    "title": "Non-Standard String Literals",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Recall from Strings that string literals prefixed by an identifier are called non-standard string literals, and can have different semantics than un-prefixed string literals. For example:r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" produces a regular expression object rather than a string\nb\"DATA\\xff\\u2200\" is a byte array literal for [68,65,84,65,255,226,136,128].Perhaps surprisingly, these behaviors are not hard-coded into the Julia parser or compiler. Instead, they are custom behaviors provided by a general mechanism that anyone can use: prefixed string literals are parsed as calls to specially-named macros. For example, the regular expression macro is just the following:macro r_str(p)\n    Regex(p)\nendThat's all. This macro says that the literal contents of the string literal r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" should be passed to the @r_str macro and the result of that expansion should be placed in the syntax tree where the string literal occurs. In other words, the expression r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" is equivalent to placing the following object directly into the syntax tree:Regex(\"^\\\\s*(?:#|\\$)\")Not only is the string literal form shorter and far more convenient, but it is also more efficient: since the regular expression is compiled and the Regex object is actually created when the code is compiled, the compilation occurs only once, rather than every time the code is executed. Consider if the regular expression occurs in a loop:for line = lines\n    m = match(r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\", line)\n    if m === nothing\n        # non-comment\n    else\n        # comment\n    end\nendSince the regular expression r\"^\\s*(?:#|$)\" is compiled and inserted into the syntax tree when this code is parsed, the expression is only compiled once instead of each time the loop is executed. In order to accomplish this without macros, one would have to write this loop like this:re = Regex(\"^\\\\s*(?:#|\\$)\")\nfor line = lines\n    m = match(re, line)\n    if m === nothing\n        # non-comment\n    else\n        # comment\n    end\nendMoreover, if the compiler could not determine that the regex object was constant over all loops, certain optimizations might not be possible, making this version still less efficient than the more convenient literal form above. Of course, there are still situations where the non-literal form is more convenient: if one needs to interpolate a variable into the regular expression, one must take this more verbose approach; in cases where the regular expression pattern itself is dynamic, potentially changing upon each loop iteration, a new regular expression object must be constructed on each iteration. In the vast majority of use cases, however, regular expressions are not constructed based on run-time data. In this majority of cases, the ability to write regular expressions as compile-time values is invaluable.Like non-standard string literals, non-standard command literals exist using a prefixed variant of the command literal syntax. The command literal custom`literal` is parsed as @custom_cmd \"literal\". Julia itself does not contain any non-standard command literals, but packages can make use of this syntax. Aside from the different syntax and the _cmd suffix instead of the _str suffix, non-standard command literals behave exactly like non-standard string literals.In the event that two modules provide non-standard string or command literals with the same name, it is possible to qualify the string or command literal with a module name. For instance, if both Foo and Bar provide non-standard string literal @x_str, then one can write Foo.x\"literal\" or Bar.x\"literal\" to disambiguate between the two.The mechanism for user-defined string literals is deeply, profoundly powerful. Not only are Julia's non-standard literals implemented using it, but also the command literal syntax (`echo \"Hello, $person\"`) is implemented with the following innocuous-looking macro:macro cmd(str)\n    :(cmd_gen($(shell_parse(str)[1])))\nendOf course, a large amount of complexity is hidden in the functions used in this macro definition, but they are just functions, written entirely in Julia. You can read their source and see precisely what they do – and all they do is construct expression objects to be inserted into your program's syntax tree."

    "page": "Metaprogramming",
    "title": "Generated functions",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "A very special macro is @generated, which allows you to define so-called generated functions. These have the capability to generate specialized code depending on the types of their arguments with more flexibility and/or less code than what can be achieved with multiple dispatch. While macros work with expressions at parsing-time and cannot access the types of their inputs, a generated function gets expanded at a time when the types of the arguments are known, but the function is not yet compiled.Instead of performing some calculation or action, a generated function declaration returns a quoted expression which then forms the body for the method corresponding to the types of the arguments. When called, the body expression is first evaluated and compiled, then the returned expression is compiled and run. To make this efficient, the result is often cached. And to make this inferable, only a limited subset of the language is usable. Thus, generated functions provide a flexible framework to move work from run-time to compile-time, at the expense of greater restrictions on the allowable constructs.When defining generated functions, there are four main differences to ordinary functions:You annotate the function declaration with the @generated macro. This adds some information to the AST that lets the compiler know that this is a generated function.\nIn the body of the generated function you only have access to the types of the arguments – not their values – and any function that was defined before the definition of the generated function.\nInstead of calculating something or performing some action, you return a quoted expression which, when evaluated, does what you want.\nGenerated functions must not mutate or observe any non-constant global state (including, for example, IO, locks, non-local dictionaries, or using method_exists). This means they can only read global constants, and cannot have any side effects. In other words, they must be completely pure. Due to an implementation limitation, this also means that they currently cannot define a closure or untyped generator.It's easiest to illustrate this with an example. We can declare a generated function foo asjulia> @generated function foo(x)\n           Core.println(x)\n           return :(x * x)\n       end\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)Note that the body returns a quoted expression, namely :(x * x), rather than just the value of x * x.From the caller's perspective, they are very similar to regular functions; in fact, you don't have to know if you're calling a regular or generated function - the syntax and result of the call is just the same. Let's see how foo behaves:julia> x = foo(2); # note: output is from println() statement in the body\nInt64\n\njulia> x           # now we print x\n4\n\njulia> y = foo(\"bar\");\nString\n\njulia> y\n\"barbar\"So, we see that in the body of the generated function, x is the type of the passed argument, and the value returned by the generated function, is the result of evaluating the quoted expression we returned from the definition, now with the value of x.What happens if we evaluate foo again with a type that we have already used?julia> foo(4)\n16Note that there is no printout of Int64. We can see that the body of the generated function was only executed once here, for the specific set of argument types, and the result was cached. After that, for this example, the expression returned from the generated function on the first invocation was re-used as the method body. However, the actual caching behavior is an implementation-defined performance optimization, so it is invalid to depend too closely on this behavior.The number of times a generated function is generated might be only once, but it might also be more often, or appear to not happen at all. As a consequence, you should never write a generated function with side effects - when, and how often, the side effects occur is undefined. (This is true for macros too - and just like for macros, the use of eval() in a generated function is a sign that you're doing something the wrong way.) However, unlike macros, the runtime system cannot correctly handle a call to eval(), so it is disallowed.It is also important to see how @generated functions interact with method redefinition. Following the principle that a correct @generated function must not observe any mutable state or cause any mutation of global state, we see the following behavior. Observe that the generated function cannot call any method that was not defined prior to the definition of the generated function itself.Initially f(x) has one definitionjulia> f(x) = \"original definition\";Define other operations that use f(x):julia> g(x) = f(x);\n\njulia> @generated gen1(x) = f(x);\n\njulia> @generated gen2(x) = :(f(x));We now add some new definitions for f(x):julia> f(x::Int) = \"definition for Int\";\n\njulia> f(x::Type{Int}) = \"definition for Type{Int}\";and compare how these results differ:julia> f(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> g(1)\n\"definition for Int\"\n\njulia> gen1(1)\n\"original definition\"\n\njulia> gen2(1)\n\"definition for Int\"Each method of a generated function has its own view of defined functions:julia> @generated gen1(x::Real) = f(x);\n\njulia> gen1(1)\n\"definition for Type{Int}\"The example generated function foo above did not do anything a normal function foo(x) = x * x could not do (except printing the type on the first invocation, and incurring higher overhead). However, the power of a generated function lies in its ability to compute different quoted expressions depending on the types passed to it:julia> @generated function bar(x)\n           if x <: Integer\n               return :(x ^ 2)\n           else\n               return :(x)\n           end\n       end\nbar (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> bar(4)\n16\n\njulia> bar(\"baz\")\n\"baz\"(although of course this contrived example would be more easily implemented using multiple dispatch...)Abusing this will corrupt the runtime system and cause undefined behavior:julia> @generated function baz(x)\n           if rand() < .9\n               return :(x^2)\n           else\n               return :(\"boo!\")\n           end\n       end\nbaz (generic function with 1 method)Since the body of the generated function is non-deterministic, its behavior, and the behavior of all subsequent code is undefined.Don't copy these examples!These examples are hopefully helpful to illustrate how generated functions work, both in the definition end and at the call site; however, don't copy them, for the following reasons:the foo function has side-effects (the call to Core.println), and it is undefined exactly when, how often or how many times these side-effects will occur\nthe bar function solves a problem that is better solved with multiple dispatch - defining bar(x) = x and bar(x::Integer) = x ^ 2 will do the same thing, but it is both simpler and faster.\nthe baz function is pathologically insaneNote that the set of operations that should not be attempted in a generated function is unbounded, and the runtime system can currently only detect a subset of the invalid operations. There are many other operations that will simply corrupt the runtime system without notification, usually in subtle ways not obviously connected to the bad definition. Because the function generator is run during inference, it must respect all of the limitations of that code.Some operations that should not be attempted include:Caching of native pointers.\nInteracting with the contents or methods of Core.Inference in any way.\nObserving any mutable state.\nInference on the generated function may be run at any time, including while your code is attempting to observe or mutate this state.\nTaking any locks: C code you call out to may use locks internally, (for example, it is not problematic to call malloc, even though most implementations require locks internally) but don't attempt to hold or acquire any while executing Julia code.\nCalling any function that is defined after the body of the generated function. This condition is relaxed for incrementally-loaded precompiled modules to allow calling any function in the module.Alright, now that we have a better understanding of how generated functions work, let's use them to build some more advanced (and valid) functionality..."

    "text": "Julia's base library has a sub2ind() function to calculate a linear index into an n-dimensional array, based on a set of n multilinear indices - in other words, to calculate the index i that can be used to index into an array A using A[i], instead of A[x,y,z,...]. One possible implementation is the following:julia> function sub2ind_loop(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n           ind = I[N] - 1\n           for i = N-1:-1:1\n               ind = I[i]-1 + dims[i]*ind\n           end\n           return ind + 1\n       end\nsub2ind_loop (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> sub2ind_loop((3, 5), 1, 2)\n4The same thing can be done using recursion:julia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{}) = 1;\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{}, i1::Integer, I::Integer...) =\n           i1 == 1 ? sub2ind_rec(dims, I...) : throw(BoundsError());\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{Integer, Vararg{Integer}}, i1::Integer) = i1;\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec(dims::Tuple{Integer, Vararg{Integer}}, i1::Integer, I::Integer...) =\n           i1 + dims[1] * (sub2ind_rec(Base.tail(dims), I...) - 1);\n\njulia> sub2ind_rec((3, 5), 1, 2)\n4Both these implementations, although different, do essentially the same thing: a runtime loop over the dimensions of the array, collecting the offset in each dimension into the final index.However, all the information we need for the loop is embedded in the type information of the arguments. Thus, we can utilize generated functions to move the iteration to compile-time; in compiler parlance, we use generated functions to manually unroll the loop. The body becomes almost identical, but instead of calculating the linear index, we build up an expression that calculates the index:julia> @generated function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n           ex = :(I[$N] - 1)\n           for i = (N - 1):-1:1\n               ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)\n           end\n           return :($ex + 1)\n       end\nsub2ind_gen (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> sub2ind_gen((3, 5), 1, 2)\n4What code will this generate?An easy way to find out is to extract the body into another (regular) function:julia> @generated function sub2ind_gen(dims::NTuple{N}, I::Integer...) where N\n           return sub2ind_gen_impl(dims, I...)\n       end\nsub2ind_gen (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function sub2ind_gen_impl(dims::Type{T}, I...) where T <: NTuple{N,Any} where N\n           length(I) == N || return :(error(\"partial indexing is unsupported\"))\n           ex = :(I[$N] - 1)\n           for i = (N - 1):-1:1\n               ex = :(I[$i] - 1 + dims[$i] * $ex)\n           end\n           return :($ex + 1)\n       end\nsub2ind_gen_impl (generic function with 1 method)We can now execute sub2ind_gen_impl and examine the expression it returns:julia> sub2ind_gen_impl(Tuple{Int,Int}, Int, Int)\n:(((I[1] - 1) + dims[1] * (I[2] - 1)) + 1)So, the method body that will be used here doesn't include a loop at all - just indexing into the two tuples, multiplication and addition/subtraction. All the looping is performed compile-time, and we avoid looping during execution entirely. Thus, we only loop once per type, in this case once per N (except in edge cases where the function is generated more than once - see disclaimer above)."

    "text": "Julia, like most technical computing languages, provides a first-class array implementation. Most technical computing languages pay a lot of attention to their array implementation at the expense of other containers. Julia does not treat arrays in any special way. The array library is implemented almost completely in Julia itself, and derives its performance from the compiler, just like any other code written in Julia. As such, it's also possible to define custom array types by inheriting from AbstractArray. See the manual section on the AbstractArray interface for more details on implementing a custom array type.An array is a collection of objects stored in a multi-dimensional grid. In the most general case, an array may contain objects of type Any. For most computational purposes, arrays should contain objects of a more specific type, such as Float64 or Int32.In general, unlike many other technical computing languages, Julia does not expect programs to be written in a vectorized style for performance. Julia's compiler uses type inference and generates optimized code for scalar array indexing, allowing programs to be written in a style that is convenient and readable, without sacrificing performance, and using less memory at times.In Julia, all arguments to functions are passed by reference. Some technical computing languages pass arrays by value, and this is convenient in many cases. In Julia, modifications made to input arrays within a function will be visible in the parent function. The entire Julia array library ensures that inputs are not modified by library functions. User code, if it needs to exhibit similar behavior, should take care to create a copy of inputs that it may modify."

Values can be specified as any iterable object, but will commonly be ranges like 1:n or 2:(n-1), or explicit arrays of values like [1.2, 3.4, 5.7].

This includes Colon (:) to select all indices within the entire dimension, ranges of the form a:c or a:b:c to select contiguous or strided subsections, and arrays of booleans to select elements at their true indices.If all the indices are scalars, then the result X is a single element from the array A. Otherwise, X is an array with the same number of dimensions as the sum of the dimensionalities of all the indices.If all indices are vectors, for example, then the shape of X would be (length(I_1), length(I_2), ..., length(I_n)), with location (i_1, i_2, ..., i_n) of X containing the value A[I_1[i_1], I_2[i_2], ..., I_n[i_n]]. If I_1 is changed to a two-dimensional matrix, then X becomes an n+1-dimensional array of shape (size(I_1, 1), size(I_1, 2), length(I_2), ..., length(I_n)). The matrix adds a dimension. The location (i_1, i_2, i_3, ..., i_{n+1}) contains the value at A[I_1[i_1, i_2], I_2[i_3], ..., I_n[i_{n+1}]]. All dimensions indexed with scalars are dropped. For example, the result of A[2, I, 3] is an array with size size(I). Its ith element is populated by A[2, I[i], 3].As a special part of this syntax, the end keyword may be used to represent the last index of each dimension within the indexing brackets, as determined by the size of the innermost array being indexed. Indexing syntax without the end keyword is equivalent to a call to getindex:X = getindex(A, I_1, I_2, ..., I_n)Example:julia> x = reshape(1:16, 4, 4)\n4×4 Base.ReshapedArray{Int64,2,UnitRange{Int64},Tuple{}}:\n 1  5   9  13\n 2  6  10  14\n 3  7  11  15\n 4  8  12  16\n\njulia> x[2:3, 2:end-1]\n2×2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 6  10\n 7  11\n\njulia> x[1, [2 3; 4 1]]\n2×2 Array{Int64,2}:\n  5  9\n 13  1Empty ranges of the form n:n-1 are sometimes used to indicate the inter-index location between n-1 and n.

    "text": "The base array type in Julia is the abstract type AbstractArray{T,N}. It is parametrized by the number of dimensions N and the element type T. AbstractVector and AbstractMatrix are aliases for the 1-d and 2-d cases. Operations on AbstractArray objects are defined using higher level operators and functions, in a way that is independent of the underlying storage. These operations generally work correctly as a fallback for any specific array implementation.The AbstractArray type includes anything vaguely array-like, and implementations of it might be quite different from conventional arrays. For example, elements might be computed on request rather than stored. However, any concrete AbstractArray{T,N} type should generally implement at least size(A) (returning an Int tuple), getindex(A,i) and getindex(A,i1,...,iN); mutable arrays should also implement setindex!(). It is recommended that these operations have nearly constant time complexity, or technically Õ(1) complexity, as otherwise some array functions may be unexpectedly slow. Concrete types should also typically provide a similar(A,T=eltype(A),dims=size(A)) method, which is used to allocate a similar array for copy() and other out-of-place operations. No matter how an AbstractArray{T,N} is represented internally, T is the type of object returned by integer indexing (A[1, ..., 1], when A is not empty) and N should be the length of the tuple returned by size().DenseArray is an abstract subtype of AbstractArray intended to include all arrays that are laid out at regular offsets in memory, and which can therefore be passed to external C and Fortran functions expecting this memory layout. Subtypes should provide a method stride(A,k) that returns the \"stride\" of dimension k: increasing the index of dimension k by 1 should increase the index i of getindex(A,i) by stride(A,k). If a pointer conversion method Base.unsafe_convert(Ptr{T}, A) is provided, the memory layout should correspond in the same way to these strides.The Array type is a specific instance of DenseArray where elements are stored in column-major order (see additional notes in Performance Tips). Vector and Matrix are aliases for the 1-d and 2-d cases. Specific operations such as scalar indexing, assignment, and a few other basic storage-specific operations are all that have to be implemented for Array, so that the rest of the array library can be implemented in a generic manner.SubArray is a specialization of AbstractArray that performs indexing by reference rather than by copying. A SubArray is created with the view() function, which is called the same way as getindex() (with an array and a series of index arguments). The result of view() looks the same as the result of getindex(), except the data is left in place. view() stores the input index vectors in a SubArray object, which can later be used to index the original array indirectly.  By putting the @views macro in front of an expression or block of code, any array[...] slice in that expression will be converted to create a SubArray view instead.StridedVector and StridedMatrix are convenient aliases defined to make it possible for Julia to call a wider range of BLAS and LAPACK functions by passing them either Array or SubArray objects, and thus saving inefficiencies from memory allocation and copying.The following example computes the QR decomposition of a small section of a larger array, without creating any temporaries, and by calling the appropriate LAPACK function with the right leading dimension size and stride parameters.julia> a = rand(10,10)\n10×10 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.561255   0.226678   0.203391  0.308912   …  0.750307  0.235023   0.217964\n 0.718915   0.537192   0.556946  0.996234      0.666232  0.509423   0.660788\n 0.493501   0.0565622  0.118392  0.493498      0.262048  0.940693   0.252965\n 0.0470779  0.736979   0.264822  0.228787      0.161441  0.897023   0.567641\n 0.343935   0.32327    0.795673  0.452242      0.468819  0.628507   0.511528\n 0.935597   0.991511   0.571297  0.74485    …  0.84589   0.178834   0.284413\n 0.160706   0.672252   0.133158  0.65554       0.371826  0.770628   0.0531208\n 0.306617   0.836126   0.301198  0.0224702     0.39344   0.0370205  0.536062\n 0.890947   0.168877   0.32002   0.486136      0.096078  0.172048   0.77672\n 0.507762   0.573567   0.220124  0.165816      0.211049  0.433277   0.539476\n\njulia> b = view(a, 2:2:8,2:2:4)\n4×2 SubArray{Float64,2,Array{Float64,2},Tuple{StepRange{Int64,Int64},StepRange{Int64,Int64}},false}:\n 0.537192  0.996234\n 0.736979  0.228787\n 0.991511  0.74485\n 0.836126  0.0224702\n\njulia> (q,r) = qr(b);\n\njulia> q\n4×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n -0.338809   0.78934\n -0.464815  -0.230274\n -0.625349   0.194538\n -0.527347  -0.534856\n\njulia> r\n2×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n -1.58553  -0.921517\n  0.0       0.866567"

    "text": "In Julia, sparse matrices are stored in the Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) format. Julia sparse matrices have the type SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, where Tv is the type of the stored values, and Ti is the integer type for storing column pointers and row indices.:struct SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti<:Integer} <: AbstractSparseMatrix{Tv,Ti}\n    m::Int                  # Number of rows\n    n::Int                  # Number of columns\n    colptr::Vector{Ti}      # Column i is in colptr[i]:(colptr[i+1]-1)\n    rowval::Vector{Ti}      # Row indices of stored values\n    nzval::Vector{Tv}       # Stored values, typically nonzeros\nendThe compressed sparse column storage makes it easy and quick to access the elements in the column of a sparse matrix, whereas accessing the sparse matrix by rows is considerably slower. Operations such as insertion of previously unstored entries one at a time in the CSC structure tend to be slow. This is because all elements of the sparse matrix that are beyond the point of insertion have to be moved one place over.All operations on sparse matrices are carefully implemented to exploit the CSC data structure for performance, and to avoid expensive operations.If you have data in CSC format from a different application or library, and wish to import it in Julia, make sure that you use 1-based indexing. The row indices in every column need to be sorted. If your SparseMatrixCSC object contains unsorted row indices, one quick way to sort them is by doing a double transpose.In some applications, it is convenient to store explicit zero values in a SparseMatrixCSC. These are accepted by functions in Base (but there is no guarantee that they will be preserved in mutating operations). Such explicitly stored zeros are treated as structural nonzeros by many routines. The nnz() function returns the number of elements explicitly stored in the sparse data structure, including structural nonzeros. In order to count the exact number of actual values that are nonzero, use countnz(), which inspects every stored element of a sparse matrix."

See the documentation on factorize for more information. As an example:julia> A = [1.5 2 -4; 3 -1 -6; -10 2.3 4]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n   1.5   2.0  -4.0\n   3.0  -1.0  -6.0\n -10.0   2.3   4.0\n\njulia> factorize(A)\nBase.LinAlg.LU{Float64,Array{Float64,2}} with factors L and U:\n[1.0 0.0 0.0; -0.15 1.0 0.0; -0.3 -0.132196 1.0]\n[-10.0 2.3 4.0; 0.0 2.345 -3.4; 0.0 0.0 -5.24947]Since A is not Hermitian, symmetric, triangular, tridiagonal, or bidiagonal, an LU factorization may be the best we can do. Compare with:julia> B = [1.5 2 -4; 2 -1 -3; -4 -3 5]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> factorize(B)\nBase.LinAlg.BunchKaufman{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}([-1.64286 0.142857 -0.8; 2.0 -2.8 -0.6; -4.0 -3.0 5.0], [1, 2, 3], 'U', true, false, 0)Here, Julia was able to detect that B is in fact symmetric, and used a more appropriate factorization. Often it's possible to write more efficient code for a matrix that is known to have certain properties e.g. it is symmetric, or tridiagonal. Julia provides some special types so that you can \"tag\" matrices as having these properties. For instance:julia> B = [1.5 2 -4; 2 -1 -3; -4 -3 5]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> sB = Symmetric(B)\n3×3 Symmetric{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0sB has been tagged as a matrix that's (real) symmetric, so for later operations we might perform on it, such as eigenfactorization or computing matrix-vector products, efficiencies can be found by only referencing half of it. For example:julia> B = [1.5 2 -4; 2 -1 -3; -4 -3 5]\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> sB = Symmetric(B)\n3×3 Symmetric{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}:\n  1.5   2.0  -4.0\n  2.0  -1.0  -3.0\n -4.0  -3.0   5.0\n\njulia> x = [1; 2; 3]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> sB\\x\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -1.73913\n -1.1087\n -1.45652The \\ operation here performs the linear solution. Julia's parser provides convenient dispatch to specialized methods for the transpose of a matrix left-divided by a vector, or for the various combinations of transpose operations in matrix-matrix solutions. Many of these are further specialized for certain special matrix types. For example, A\\B will end up calling Base.LinAlg.A_ldiv_B! while A'\\B will end up calling Base.LinAlg.Ac_ldiv_B, even though we used the same left-division operator. This works for matrices too: A.'\\B.' would call Base.LinAlg.At_ldiv_Bt. The left-division operator is pretty powerful and it's easy to write compact, readable code that is flexible enough to solve all sorts of systems of linear equations."

Now, as you can see from this example, write() takes the data to write as its second argument, while read() takes the type of the data to be read as the second argument.For example, to read a simple byte array, we could do:julia> x = zeros(UInt8, 4)\n4-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x00\n 0x00\n 0x00\n 0x00\n\njulia> read!(STDIN, x)\nabcd\n4-element Array{UInt8,1}:\n 0x61\n 0x62\n 0x63\n 0x64However, since this is slightly cumbersome, there are several convenience methods provided.

This is because the IOStream must be closed before the write is actually flushed to disk:julia> close(f)Examining hello.txt again will show its contents have been changed.Opening a file, doing something to its contents, and closing it again is a very common pattern. To make this easier, there exists another invocation of open() which takes a function as its first argument and filename as its second, opens the file, calls the function with the file as an argument, and then closes it again. For example, given a function:function read_and_capitalize(f::IOStream)\n    return uppercase(readstring(f))\nendYou can call:julia> open(read_and_capitalize, \"hello.txt\")\n\"HELLO AGAIN.\"to open hello.txt, call read_and_capitalize on it, close hello.txt and return the capitalized contents.To avoid even having to define a named function, you can use the do syntax, which creates an anonymous function on the fly:julia> open(\"hello.txt\") do f\n           uppercase(readstring(f))\n       end\n\"HELLO AGAIN.\""

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Let's jump right in with a simple example involving TCP sockets. Let's first create a simple server:julia> @async begin\n           server = listen(2000)\n           while true\n               sock = accept(server)\n               println(\"Hello World\\n\")\n           end\n       end\nTask (runnable) @0x00007fd31dc11ae0To those familiar with the Unix socket API, the method names will feel familiar, though their usage is somewhat simpler than the raw Unix socket API. The first call to listen() will create a server waiting for incoming connections on the specified port (2000) in this case. The same function may also be used to create various other kinds of servers:julia> listen(2000) # Listens on localhost:2000 (IPv4)\nTCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(ip\"127.0.0.1\",2000) # Equivalent to the first\nTCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(ip\"::1\",2000) # Listens on localhost:2000 (IPv6)\nTCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(IPv4(0),2001) # Listens on port 2001 on all IPv4 interfaces\nTCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(IPv6(0),2001) # Listens on port 2001 on all IPv6 interfaces\nTCPServer(active)\n\njulia> listen(\"testsocket\") # Listens on a UNIX domain socket/named pipe\nPipeServer(active)Note that the return type of the last invocation is different. This is because this server does not listen on TCP, but rather on a named pipe (Windows) or UNIX domain socket. The difference is subtle and has to do with the accept() and connect() methods. The accept() method retrieves a connection to the client that is connecting on the server we just created, while the connect() function connects to a server using the specified method. The connect() function takes the same arguments as listen(), so, assuming the environment (i.e. host, cwd, etc.) is the same you should be able to pass the same arguments to connect() as you did to listen to establish the connection. So let's try that out (after having created the server above):julia> connect(2000)\nTCPSocket(open, 0 bytes waiting)\n\njulia> Hello WorldAs expected we saw \"Hello World\" printed. So, let's actually analyze what happened behind the scenes. When we called connect(), we connect to the server we had just created. Meanwhile, the accept function returns a server-side connection to the newly created socket and prints \"Hello World\" to indicate that the connection was successful.A great strength of Julia is that since the API is exposed synchronously even though the I/O is actually happening asynchronously, we didn't have to worry callbacks or even making sure that the server gets to run. When we called connect() the current task waited for the connection to be established and only continued executing after that was done. In this pause, the server task resumed execution (because a connection request was now available), accepted the connection, printed the message and waited for the next client. Reading and writing works in the same way. To see this, consider the following simple echo server:julia> @async begin\n           server = listen(2001)\n           while true\n               sock = accept(server)\n               @async while isopen(sock)\n                   write(sock,readline(sock))\n               end\n           end\n       end\nTask (runnable) @0x00007fd31dc12e60\n\njulia> clientside = connect(2001)\nTCPSocket(RawFD(28) open, 0 bytes waiting)\n\njulia> @async while true\n           write(STDOUT,readline(clientside))\n       end\nTask (runnable) @0x00007fd31dc11870\n\njulia> println(clientside,\"Hello World from the Echo Server\")\nHello World from the Echo ServerAs with other streams, use close() to disconnect the socket:julia> close(clientside)"

    "text": "Most modern computers possess more than one CPU, and several computers can be combined together in a cluster. Harnessing the power of these multiple CPUs allows many computations to be completed more quickly. There are two major factors that influence performance: the speed of the CPUs themselves, and the speed of their access to memory. In a cluster, it's fairly obvious that a given CPU will have fastest access to the RAM within the same computer (node). Perhaps more surprisingly, similar issues are relevant on a typical multicore laptop, due to differences in the speed of main memory and the cache. Consequently, a good multiprocessing environment should allow control over the \"ownership\" of a chunk of memory by a particular CPU. Julia provides a multiprocessing environment based on message passing to allow programs to run on multiple processes in separate memory domains at once.Julia's implementation of message passing is different from other environments such as MPI [1]. Communication in Julia is generally \"one-sided\", meaning that the programmer needs to explicitly manage only one process in a two-process operation. Furthermore, these operations typically do not look like \"message send\" and \"message receive\" but rather resemble higher-level operations like calls to user functions.Parallel programming in Julia is built on two primitives: remote references and remote calls. A remote reference is an object that can be used from any process to refer to an object stored on a particular process. A remote call is a request by one process to call a certain function on certain arguments on another (possibly the same) process.Remote references come in two flavors: Future and RemoteChannel.A remote call returns a Future to its result. Remote calls return immediately; the process that made the call proceeds to its next operation while the remote call happens somewhere else. You can wait for a remote call to finish by calling wait() on the returned Future, and you can obtain the full value of the result using fetch().On the other hand, RemoteChannel s are rewritable. For example, multiple processes can co-ordinate their processing by referencing the same remote Channel.Each process has an associated identifier. The process providing the interactive Julia prompt always has an id equal to 1. The processes used by default for parallel operations are referred to as \"workers\". When there is only one process, process 1 is considered a worker. Otherwise, workers are considered to be all processes other than process 1.Let's try this out. Starting with julia -p n provides n worker processes on the local machine. Generally it makes sense for n to equal the number of CPU cores on the machine.$ ./julia -p 2\n\njulia> r = remotecall(rand, 2, 2, 2)\nFuture(2, 1, 4, Nullable{Any}())\n\njulia> s = @spawnat 2 1 .+ fetch(r)\nFuture(2, 1, 5, Nullable{Any}())\n\njulia> fetch(s)\n2×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.18526  1.50912\n 1.16296  1.60607The first argument to remotecall() is the function to call. Most parallel programming in Julia does not reference specific processes or the number of processes available, but remotecall() is considered a low-level interface providing finer control. The second argument to remotecall() is the id of the process that will do the work, and the remaining arguments will be passed to the function being called.As you can see, in the first line we asked process 2 to construct a 2-by-2 random matrix, and in the second line we asked it to add 1 to it. The result of both calculations is available in the two futures, r and s. The @spawnat macro evaluates the expression in the second argument on the process specified by the first argument.Occasionally you might want a remotely-computed value immediately. This typically happens when you read from a remote object to obtain data needed by the next local operation. The function remotecall_fetch() exists for this purpose. It is equivalent to fetch(remotecall(...)) but is more efficient.julia> remotecall_fetch(getindex, 2, r, 1, 1)\n0.18526337335308085Remember that getindex(r,1,1) is equivalent to r[1,1], so this call fetches the first element of the future r.The syntax of remotecall() is not especially convenient. The macro @spawn makes things easier. It operates on an expression rather than a function, and picks where to do the operation for you:julia> r = @spawn rand(2,2)\nFuture(2, 1, 4, Nullable{Any}())\n\njulia> s = @spawn 1 .+ fetch(r)\nFuture(3, 1, 5, Nullable{Any}())\n\njulia> fetch(s)\n2×2 Array{Float64,2}:\n 1.38854  1.9098\n 1.20939  1.57158Note that we used 1 .+ fetch(r) instead of 1 .+ r. This is because we do not know where the code will run, so in general a fetch() might be required to move r to the process doing the addition. In this case, @spawn is smart enough to perform the computation on the process that owns r, so the fetch() will be a no-op (no work is done).(It is worth noting that @spawn is not built-in but defined in Julia as a macro. It is possible to define your own such constructs.)An important thing to remember is that, once fetched, a Future will cache its value locally. Further fetch() calls do not entail a network hop. Once all referencing Futures have fetched, the remote stored value is deleted."

For example, @everywhere can also be used to directly define a function on all processes:julia> @everywhere id = myid()\n\njulia> remotecall_fetch(()->id, 2)\n2A file can also be preloaded on multiple processes at startup, and a driver script can be used to drive the computation:julia -p <n> -L file1.jl -L file2.jl driver.jlThe Julia process running the driver script in the example above has an id equal to 1, just like a process providing an interactive prompt.The base Julia installation has in-built support for two types of clusters:A local cluster specified with the -p option as shown above.\nA cluster spanning machines using the --machinefile option. This uses a passwordless ssh login to start Julia worker processes (from the same path as the current host) on the specified machines.Functions addprocs(), rmprocs(), workers(), and others are available as a programmatic means of adding, removing and querying the processes in a cluster.Note that workers do not run a .juliarc.jl startup script, nor do they synchronize their global state (such as global variables, new method definitions, and loaded modules) with any of the other running processes.Other types of clusters can be supported by writing your own custom ClusterManager, as described below in the ClusterManagers section."

    "text": "Sending messages and moving data constitute most of the overhead in a parallel program. Reducing the number of messages and the amount of data sent is critical to achieving performance and scalability. To this end, it is important to understand the data movement performed by Julia's various parallel programming constructs.fetch() can be considered an explicit data movement operation, since it directly asks that an object be moved to the local machine. @spawn (and a few related constructs) also moves data, but this is not as obvious, hence it can be called an implicit data movement operation. Consider these two approaches to constructing and squaring a random matrix:Method 1:julia> A = rand(1000,1000);\n\njulia> Bref = @spawn A^2;\n\n[...]\n\njulia> fetch(Bref);Method 2:julia> Bref = @spawn rand(1000,1000)^2;\n\n[...]\n\njulia> fetch(Bref);The difference seems trivial, but in fact is quite significant due to the behavior of @spawn. In the first method, a random matrix is constructed locally, then sent to another process where it is squared. In the second method, a random matrix is both constructed and squared on another process. Therefore the second method sends much less data than the first.In this toy example, the two methods are easy to distinguish and choose from. However, in a real program designing data movement might require more thought and likely some measurement. For example, if the first process needs matrix A then the first method might be better. Or, if computing A is expensive and only the current process has it, then moving it to another process might be unavoidable. Or, if the current process has very little to do between the @spawn and fetch(Bref), it might be better to eliminate the parallelism altogether. Or imagine rand(1000,1000) is replaced with a more expensive operation. Then it might make sense to add another @spawn statement just for this step."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Expressions executed remotely via @spawn, or closures specified for remote execution using remotecall may refer to global variables. Global bindings under module Main are treated a little differently compared to global bindings in other modules. Consider the following code snippet:A = rand(10,10)\nremotecall_fetch(()->foo(A), 2)Note that A is a global variable defined in the local workspace. Worker 2 does not have a variable called A under Main. The act of shipping the closure ()->foo(A) to worker 2 results in Main.A being defined on 2. Main.A continues to exist on worker 2 even after the call remotecall_fetch returns. Remote calls with embedded global references (under Main module only) manage globals as follows:New global bindings are created on destination workers if they are referenced as part of a remote call.\nGlobal constants are declared as constants on remote nodes too.\nGlobals are re-sent to a destination worker only in the context of a remote call, and then only if its value has changed. Also, the cluster does not synchronize global bindings across nodes. For example:\nA = rand(10,10)\nremotecall_fetch(()->foo(A), 2) # worker 2\nA = rand(10,10)\nremotecall_fetch(()->foo(A), 3) # worker 3\nA = nothing\nExecuting the above snippet results in Main.A on worker 2 having a different value from Main.A on worker 3, while the value of Main.A on node 1 is set to nothing.As you may have realized, while memory associated with globals may be collected when they are reassigned on the master, no such action is taken on the workers as the bindings continue to be valid. clear! can be used to manually reassign specific globals on remote nodes to nothing once they are no longer required. This will release any memory associated with them as part of a regular garbage collection cycle.Thus programs should be careful referencing globals in remote calls. In fact, it is preferable to avoid them altogether if possible. If you must reference globals, consider using let blocks to localize global variables.For example:julia> A = rand(10,10);\n\njulia> remotecall_fetch(()->A, 2);\n\njulia> B = rand(10,10);\n\njulia> let B = B\n           remotecall_fetch(()->B, 2)\n       end;\n\njulia> @spawnat 2 whos();\n\njulia>  From worker 2:                               A    800 bytes  10×10 Array{Float64,2}\n        From worker 2:                            Base               Module\n        From worker 2:                            Core               Module\n        From worker 2:                            Main               ModuleAs can be seen, global variable A is defined on worker 2, but B is captured as a local variable and hence a binding for B does not exist on worker 2."

    "text": "Fortunately, many useful parallel computations do not require data movement. A common example is a Monte Carlo simulation, where multiple processes can handle independent simulation trials simultaneously. We can use @spawn to flip coins on two processes. First, write the following function in count_heads.jl:function count_heads(n)\n    c::Int = 0\n    for i = 1:n\n        c += rand(Bool)\n    end\n    c\nendThe function count_heads simply adds together n random bits. Here is how we can perform some trials on two machines, and add together the results:julia> @everywhere include(\"count_heads.jl\")\n\njulia> a = @spawn count_heads(100000000)\nFuture(2, 1, 6, Nullable{Any}())\n\njulia> b = @spawn count_heads(100000000)\nFuture(3, 1, 7, Nullable{Any}())\n\njulia> fetch(a)+fetch(b)\n100001564This example demonstrates a powerful and often-used parallel programming pattern. Many iterations run independently over several processes, and then their results are combined using some function. The combination process is called a reduction, since it is generally tensor-rank-reducing: a vector of numbers is reduced to a single number, or a matrix is reduced to a single row or column, etc. In code, this typically looks like the pattern x = f(x,v[i]), where x is the accumulator, f is the reduction function, and the v[i] are the elements being reduced. It is desirable for f to be associative, so that it does not matter what order the operations are performed in.Notice that our use of this pattern with count_heads can be generalized. We used two explicit @spawn statements, which limits the parallelism to two processes. To run on any number of processes, we can use a parallel for loop, which can be written in Julia using @parallel like this:nheads = @parallel (+) for i = 1:200000000\n    Int(rand(Bool))\nendThis construct implements the pattern of assigning iterations to multiple processes, and combining them with a specified reduction (in this case (+)). The result of each iteration is taken as the value of the last expression inside the loop. The whole parallel loop expression itself evaluates to the final answer.Note that although parallel for loops look like serial for loops, their behavior is dramatically different. In particular, the iterations do not happen in a specified order, and writes to variables or arrays will not be globally visible since iterations run on different processes. Any variables used inside the parallel loop will be copied and broadcast to each process.For example, the following code will not work as intended:a = zeros(100000)\n@parallel for i = 1:100000\n    a[i] = i\nendThis code will not initialize all of a, since each process will have a separate copy of it. Parallel for loops like these must be avoided. Fortunately, Shared Arrays can be used to get around this limitation:a = SharedArray{Float64}(10)\n@parallel for i = 1:10\n    a[i] = i\nendUsing \"outside\" variables in parallel loops is perfectly reasonable if the variables are read-only:a = randn(1000)\n@parallel (+) for i = 1:100000\n    f(a[rand(1:end)])\nendHere each iteration applies f to a randomly-chosen sample from a vector a shared by all processes.As you could see, the reduction operator can be omitted if it is not needed. In that case, the loop executes asynchronously, i.e. it spawns independent tasks on all available workers and returns an array of Future immediately without waiting for completion. The caller can wait for the Future completions at a later point by calling fetch() on them, or wait for completion at the end of the loop by prefixing it with @sync, like @sync @parallel for.In some cases no reduction operator is needed, and we merely wish to apply a function to all integers in some range (or, more generally, to all elements in some collection). This is another useful operation called parallel map, implemented in Julia as the pmap() function. For example, we could compute the singular values of several large random matrices in parallel as follows:julia> M = Matrix{Float64}[rand(1000,1000) for i = 1:10];\n\njulia> pmap(svd, M);Julia's pmap() is designed for the case where each function call does a large amount of work. In contrast, @parallel for can handle situations where each iteration is tiny, perhaps merely summing two numbers. Only worker processes are used by both pmap() and @parallel for for the parallel computation. In case of @parallel for, the final reduction is done on the calling process."

    "text": "Julia's parallel programming platform uses Tasks (aka Coroutines) to switch among multiple computations. Whenever code performs a communication operation like fetch() or wait(), the current task is suspended and a scheduler picks another task to run. A task is restarted when the event it is waiting for completes.For many problems, it is not necessary to think about tasks directly. However, they can be used to wait for multiple events at the same time, which provides for dynamic scheduling. In dynamic scheduling, a program decides what to compute or where to compute it based on when other jobs finish. This is needed for unpredictable or unbalanced workloads, where we want to assign more work to processes only when they finish their current tasks.As an example, consider computing the singular values of matrices of different sizes:julia> M = Matrix{Float64}[rand(800,800), rand(600,600), rand(800,800), rand(600,600)];\n\njulia> pmap(svd, M);If one process handles both 800×800 matrices and another handles both 600×600 matrices, we will not get as much scalability as we could. The solution is to make a local task to \"feed\" work to each process when it completes its current task. For example, consider a simple pmap() implementation:function pmap(f, lst)\n    np = nprocs()  # determine the number of processes available\n    n = length(lst)\n    results = Vector{Any}(n)\n    i = 1\n    # function to produce the next work item from the queue.\n    # in this case it's just an index.\n    nextidx() = (idx=i; i+=1; idx)\n    @sync begin\n        for p=1:np\n            if p != myid() || np == 1\n                @async begin\n                    while true\n                        idx = nextidx()\n                        if idx > n\n                            break\n                        end\n                        results[idx] = remotecall_fetch(f, p, lst[idx])\n                    end\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    results\nend@async is similar to @spawn, but only runs tasks on the local process. We use it to create a \"feeder\" task for each process. Each task picks the next index that needs to be computed, then waits for its process to finish, then repeats until we run out of indexes. Note that the feeder tasks do not begin to execute until the main task reaches the end of the @sync block, at which point it surrenders control and waits for all the local tasks to complete before returning from the function. The feeder tasks are able to share state via nextidx() because they all run on the same process. No locking is required, since the threads are scheduled cooperatively and not preemptively. This means context switches only occur at well-defined points: in this case, when remotecall_fetch() is called."

Channels can be quite useful to pass data between running tasks, particularly those involving I/O operations.Examples of operations involving I/O include reading/writing to files, accessing web services, executing external programs, etc. In all these cases, overall execution time can be improved if other tasks can be run while a file is being read, or while waiting for an external service/program to complete.A channel can be visualized as a pipe, i.e., it has a write end and read end.Multiple writers in different tasks can write to the same channel concurrently via put!() calls.\nMultiple readers in different tasks can read data concurrently via take!() calls.\nAs an example:\n# Given Channels c1 and c2,\nc1 = Channel(32)\nc2 = Channel(32)\n\n# and a function `foo()` which reads items from from c1, processes the item read\n# and writes a result to c2,\nfunction foo()\n    while true\n        data = take!(c1)\n        [...]               # process data\n        put!(c2, result)    # write out result\n    end\nend\n\n# we can schedule `n` instances of `foo()` to be active concurrently.\nfor _ in 1:n\n    @schedule foo()\nend\nChannels are created via the Channel{T}(sz) constructor. The channel will only hold objects of type T. If the type is not specified, the channel can hold objects of any type. sz refers to the maximum number of elements that can be held in the channel at any time. For example, Channel(32) creates a channel that can hold a maximum of 32 objects of any type. A Channel{MyType}(64) can hold up to 64 objects of MyType at any time.\nIf a Channel is empty, readers (on a take!() call) will block until data is available.\nIf a Channel is full, writers (on a put!() call) will block until space becomes available.\nisready() tests for the presence of any object in the channel, while wait() waits for an object to become available.\nA Channel is in an open state initially. This means that it can be read from and written to freely via take!() and put!() calls. close() closes a Channel. On a closed Channel, put!() will fail. For example:julia> c = Channel(2);\n\njulia> put!(c, 1) # `put!` on an open channel succeeds\n1\n\njulia> close(c);\n\njulia> put!(c, 2) # `put!` on a closed channel throws an exception.\nERROR: InvalidStateException(\"Channel is closed.\",:closed)\n[...]take!() and fetch() (which retrieves but does not remove the value) on a closed channel successfully return any existing values until it is emptied. Continuing the above example:julia> fetch(c) # Any number of `fetch` calls succeed.\n1\n\njulia> fetch(c)\n1\n\njulia> take!(c) # The first `take!` removes the value.\n1\n\njulia> take!(c) # No more data available on a closed channel.\nERROR: InvalidStateException(\"Channel is closed.\",:closed)\n[...]A Channel can be used as an iterable object in a for loop, in which case the loop runs as long as the Channel has data or is open. The loop variable takes on all values added to the Channel. The for loop is terminated once the Channel is closed and emptied.For example, the following would cause the for loop to wait for more data:julia> c = Channel{Int}(10);\n\njulia> foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:3) # add a few entries\n\njulia> data = [i for i in c]while this will return after reading all data:julia> c = Channel{Int}(10);\n\njulia> foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:3); # add a few entries\n\njulia> close(c);                    # `for` loops can exit\n\njulia> data = [i for i in c]\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3Consider a simple example using channels for inter-task communication. We start 4 tasks to process data from a single jobs channel. Jobs, identified by an id (job_id), are written to the channel. Each task in this simulation reads a job_id, waits for a random amout of time and writes back a tuple of job_id and the simulated time to the results channel. Finally all the results are printed out.julia> const jobs = Channel{Int}(32);\n\njulia> const results = Channel{Tuple}(32);\n\njulia> function do_work()\n           for job_id in jobs\n               exec_time = rand()\n               sleep(exec_time)                # simulates elapsed time doing actual work\n                                               # typically performed externally.\n               put!(results, (job_id, exec_time))\n           end\n       end;\n\njulia> function make_jobs(n)\n           for i in 1:n\n               put!(jobs, i)\n           end\n       end;\n\njulia> n = 12;\n\njulia> @schedule make_jobs(n); # feed the jobs channel with \"n\" jobs\n\njulia> for i in 1:4 # start 4 tasks to process requests in parallel\n           @schedule do_work()\n       end\n\njulia> @elapsed while n > 0 # print out results\n           job_id, exec_time = take!(results)\n           println(\"$job_id finished in $(round(exec_time,2)) seconds\")\n           n = n - 1\n       end\n4 finished in 0.22 seconds\n3 finished in 0.45 seconds\n1 finished in 0.5 seconds\n7 finished in 0.14 seconds\n2 finished in 0.78 seconds\n5 finished in 0.9 seconds\n9 finished in 0.36 seconds\n6 finished in 0.87 seconds\n8 finished in 0.79 seconds\n10 finished in 0.64 seconds\n12 finished in 0.5 seconds\n11 finished in 0.97 seconds\n0.029772311The current version of Julia multiplexes all tasks onto a single OS thread. Thus, while tasks involving I/O operations benefit from parallel execution, compute bound tasks are effectively executed sequentially on a single OS thread. Future versions of Julia may support scheduling of tasks on multiple threads, in which case compute bound tasks will see benefits of parallel execution too."

The channel exists on worker pid.Methods put!(), take!(), fetch(), isready() and wait() on a RemoteChannel are proxied onto the backing store on the remote process.RemoteChannel can thus be used to refer to user implemented AbstractChannel objects.

A RemoteChannel, however, can put and take values across workers.\nA RemoteChannel can be thought of as a handle to a Channel.\nThe process id, pid, associated with a RemoteChannel identifies the process where the backing store, i.e., the backing Channel exists.\nAny process with a reference to a RemoteChannel can put and take items from the channel. Data is automatically sent to (or retrieved from) the process a RemoteChannel is associated with.\nSerializing  a Channel also serializes any data present in the channel. Deserializing it therefore effectively makes a copy of the original object.\nOn the other hand, serializing a RemoteChannel only involves the serialization of an identifier that identifies the location and instance of Channel referred to by the handle. A deserialized RemoteChannel object (on any worker), therefore also points to the same backing store as the original.The channels example from above can be modified for interprocess communication, as shown below.We start 4 workers to process a single jobs remote channel.

    "text": "Objects referred to by remote references can be freed only when all held references in the cluster are deleted.The node where the value is stored keeps track of which of the workers have a reference to it. Every time a RemoteChannel or a (unfetched) Future is serialized to a worker, the node pointed to by the reference is notified. And every time a RemoteChannel or a (unfetched) Future is garbage collected locally, the node owning the value is again notified.The notifications are done via sending of \"tracking\" messages–an \"add reference\" message when a reference is serialized to a different process and a \"delete reference\" message when a reference is locally garbage collected.Since Futures are write-once and cached locally, the act of fetch()ing a Future also updates reference tracking information on the node owning the value.The node which owns the value frees it once all references to it are cleared.With Futures, serializing an already fetched Future to a different node also sends the value since the original remote store may have collected the value by this time.It is important to note that when an object is locally garbage collected depends on the size of the object and the current memory pressure in the system.In case of remote references, the size of the local reference object is quite small, while the value stored on the remote node may be quite large. Since the local object may not be collected immediately, it is a good practice to explicitly call finalize() on local instances of a RemoteChannel, or on unfetched Futures. Since calling fetch() on a Future also removes its reference from the remote store, this is not required on fetched Futures. Explicitly calling finalize() results in an immediate message sent to the remote node to go ahead and remove its reference to the value.Once finalized, a reference becomes invalid and cannot be used in any further calls."

    "title": "Shared Arrays",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Shared Arrays use system shared memory to map the same array across many processes. While there are some similarities to a DArray, the behavior of a SharedArray is quite different. In a DArray, each process has local access to just a chunk of the data, and no two processes share the same chunk; in contrast, in a SharedArray each \"participating\" process has access to the entire array.  A SharedArray is a good choice when you want to have a large amount of data jointly accessible to two or more processes on the same machine.SharedArray indexing (assignment and accessing values) works just as with regular arrays, and is efficient because the underlying memory is available to the local process. Therefore, most algorithms work naturally on SharedArrays, albeit in single-process mode. In cases where an algorithm insists on an Array input, the underlying array can be retrieved from a SharedArray by calling sdata(). For other AbstractArray types, sdata() just returns the object itself, so it's safe to use sdata() on any Array-type object.The constructor for a shared array is of the form:SharedArray{T,N}(dims::NTuple; init=false, pids=Int[])which creates an N-dimensional shared array of a bits type T and size dims across the processes specified by pids. Unlike distributed arrays, a shared array is accessible only from those participating workers specified by the pids named argument (and the creating process too, if it is on the same host).If an init function, of signature initfn(S::SharedArray), is specified, it is called on all the participating workers. You can specify that each worker runs the init function on a distinct portion of the array, thereby parallelizing initialization.Here's a brief example:julia> addprocs(3)\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 3\n 4\n\njulia> S = SharedArray{Int,2}((3,4), init = S -> S[Base.localindexes(S)] = myid())\n3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:\n 2  2  3  4\n 2  3  3  4\n 2  3  4  4\n\njulia> S[3,2] = 7\n7\n\njulia> S\n3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:\n 2  2  3  4\n 2  3  3  4\n 2  7  4  4Base.localindexes() provides disjoint one-dimensional ranges of indexes, and is sometimes convenient for splitting up tasks among processes. You can, of course, divide the work any way you wish:julia> S = SharedArray{Int,2}((3,4), init = S -> S[indexpids(S):length(procs(S)):length(S)] = myid())\n3×4 SharedArray{Int64,2}:\n 2  2  2  2\n 3  3  3  3\n 4  4  4  4Since all processes have access to the underlying data, you do have to be careful not to set up conflicts. For example:@sync begin\n    for p in procs(S)\n        @async begin\n            remotecall_wait(fill!, p, S, p)\n        end\n    end\nendwould result in undefined behavior. Because each process fills the entire array with its own pid, whichever process is the last to execute (for any particular element of S) will have its pid retained.As a more extended and complex example, consider running the following \"kernel\" in parallel:q[i,j,t+1] = q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]In this case, if we try to split up the work using a one-dimensional index, we are likely to run into trouble: if q[i,j,t] is near the end of the block assigned to one worker and q[i,j,t+1] is near the beginning of the block assigned to another, it's very likely that q[i,j,t] will not be ready at the time it's needed for computing q[i,j,t+1]. In such cases, one is better off chunking the array manually. Let's split along the second dimension. Define a function that returns the (irange, jrange) indexes assigned to this worker:julia> @everywhere function myrange(q::SharedArray)\n           idx = indexpids(q)\n           if idx == 0 # This worker is not assigned a piece\n               return 1:0, 1:0\n           end\n           nchunks = length(procs(q))\n           splits = [round(Int, s) for s in linspace(0,size(q,2),nchunks+1)]\n           1:size(q,1), splits[idx]+1:splits[idx+1]\n       endNext, define the kernel:julia> @everywhere function advection_chunk!(q, u, irange, jrange, trange)\n           @show (irange, jrange, trange)  # display so we can see what's happening\n           for t in trange, j in jrange, i in irange\n               q[i,j,t+1] = q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]\n           end\n           q\n       endWe also define a convenience wrapper for a SharedArray implementationjulia> @everywhere advection_shared_chunk!(q, u) =\n           advection_chunk!(q, u, myrange(q)..., 1:size(q,3)-1)Now let's compare three different versions, one that runs in a single process:julia> advection_serial!(q, u) = advection_chunk!(q, u, 1:size(q,1), 1:size(q,2), 1:size(q,3)-1);one that uses @parallel:julia> function advection_parallel!(q, u)\n           for t = 1:size(q,3)-1\n               @sync @parallel for j = 1:size(q,2)\n                   for i = 1:size(q,1)\n                       q[i,j,t+1]= q[i,j,t] + u[i,j,t]\n                   end\n               end\n           end\n           q\n       end;and one that delegates in chunks:julia> function advection_shared!(q, u)\n           @sync begin\n               for p in procs(q)\n                   @async remotecall_wait(advection_shared_chunk!, p, q, u)\n               end\n           end\n           q\n       end;If we create SharedArrays and time these functions, we get the following results (with julia -p 4):julia> q = SharedArray{Float64,3}((500,500,500));\n\njulia> u = SharedArray{Float64,3}((500,500,500));Run the functions once to JIT-compile and @time them on the second run:julia> @time advection_serial!(q, u);\n(irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,1:500,1:499)\n 830.220 milliseconds (216 allocations: 13820 bytes)\n\njulia> @time advection_parallel!(q, u);\n   2.495 seconds      (3999 k allocations: 289 MB, 2.09% gc time)\n\njulia> @time advection_shared!(q,u);\n        From worker 2:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,1:125,1:499)\n        From worker 4:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,251:375,1:499)\n        From worker 3:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,126:250,1:499)\n        From worker 5:       (irange,jrange,trange) = (1:500,376:500,1:499)\n 238.119 milliseconds (2264 allocations: 169 KB)The biggest advantage of advection_shared! is that it minimizes traffic among the workers, allowing each to compute for an extended time on the assigned piece."

A ClusterManager is responsible forlaunching worker processes in a cluster environment\nmanaging events during the lifetime of each worker\noptionally, providing data transportA Julia cluster has the following characteristics:The initial Julia process, also called the master, is special and has an id of 1.\nOnly the master process can add or remove worker processes.\nAll processes can directly communicate with each other.Connections between workers (using the in-built TCP/IP transport) is established in the following manner:addprocs() is called on the master process with a ClusterManager object.\naddprocs() calls the appropriate launch() method which spawns required number of worker processes on appropriate machines.\nEach worker starts listening on a free port and writes out its host and port information to STDOUT.\nThe cluster manager captures the STDOUT of each worker and makes it available to the master process.\nThe master process parses this information and sets up TCP/IP connections to each worker.\nEvery worker is also notified of other workers in the cluster.\nEach worker connects to all workers whose id is less than the worker's own id.\nIn this way a mesh network is established, wherein every worker is directly connected with every other worker.While the default transport layer uses plain TCPSocket, it is possible for a Julia cluster to provide its own transport.Julia provides two in-built cluster managers:LocalManager, used when addprocs() or addprocs(np::Integer) are called\nSSHManager, used when addprocs(hostnames::Array) is called with a list of hostnamesLocalManager is used to launch additional workers on the same host, thereby leveraging multi-core and multi-processor hardware.Thus, a minimal cluster manager would need to:be a subtype of the abstract ClusterManager\nimplement launch(), a method responsible for launching new workers\nimplement manage(), which is called at various events during a worker's lifetime (for example, sending an interrupt signal)addprocs(manager::FooManager) requires FooManager to implement:function launch(manager::FooManager, params::Dict, launched::Array, c::Condition)\n    [...]\nend\n\nfunction manage(manager::FooManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig, op::Symbol)\n    [...]\nendAs an example let us see how the LocalManager, the manager responsible for starting workers on the same host, is implemented:struct LocalManager <: ClusterManager\n    np::Integer\nend\n\nfunction launch(manager::LocalManager, params::Dict, launched::Array, c::Condition)\n    [...]\nend\n\nfunction manage(manager::LocalManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig, op::Symbol)\n    [...]\nendThe launch() method takes the following arguments:manager::ClusterManager: the cluster manager that addprocs() is called with\nparams::Dict: all the keyword arguments passed to addprocs()\nlaunched::Array: the array to append one or more WorkerConfig objects to\nc::Condition: the condition variable to be notified as and when workers are launchedThe launch() method is called asynchronously in a separate task. The termination of this task signals that all requested workers have been launched. Hence the launch() function MUST exit as soon as all the requested workers have been launched.Newly launched workers are connected to each other, and the master process, in an all-to-all manner. Specifying the command argument --worker <cookie> results in the launched processes initializing themselves as workers and connections being set up via TCP/IP sockets. Optionally, --bind-to bind_addr[:port] may also be specified to enable other workers to connect to it at the specified bind_addr and port. This is useful for multi-homed hosts.As an example of a non-TCP/IP transport, an implementation may choose to use MPI, in which case --worker must NOT be specified. Instead, newly launched workers should call init_worker(cookie) before using any of the parallel constructs.For every worker launched, the launch() method must add a WorkerConfig object (with appropriate fields initialized) to launchedmutable struct WorkerConfig\n    # Common fields relevant to all cluster managers\n    io::Nullable{IO}\n    host::Nullable{AbstractString}\n    port::Nullable{Integer}\n\n    # Used when launching additional workers at a host\n    count::Nullable{Union{Int, Symbol}}\n    exename::Nullable{AbstractString}\n    exeflags::Nullable{Cmd}\n\n    # External cluster managers can use this to store information at a per-worker level\n    # Can be a dict if multiple fields need to be stored.\n    userdata::Nullable{Any}\n\n    # SSHManager / SSH tunnel connections to workers\n    tunnel::Nullable{Bool}\n    bind_addr::Nullable{AbstractString}\n    sshflags::Nullable{Cmd}\n    max_parallel::Nullable{Integer}\n\n    connect_at::Nullable{Any}\n\n    [...]\nendMost of the fields in WorkerConfig are used by the inbuilt managers. Custom cluster managers would typically specify only io or host / port:If io is specified, it is used to read host/port information. A Julia worker prints out its bind address and port at startup. This allows Julia workers to listen on any free port available instead of requiring worker ports to be configured manually.\nIf io is not specified, host and port are used to connect.\ncount, exename and exeflags are relevant for launching additional workers from a worker. For example, a cluster manager may launch a single worker per node, and use that to launch additional workers.\ncount with an integer value n will launch a total of n workers.\ncount with a value of :auto will launch as many workers as the number of cores on that machine.\nexename is the name of the julia executable including the full path.\nexeflags should be set to the required command line arguments for new workers.\ntunnel, bind_addr, sshflags and max_parallel are used when a ssh tunnel is required to connect to the workers from the master process.\nuserdata is provided for custom cluster managers to store their own worker-specific information.manage(manager::FooManager, id::Integer, config::WorkerConfig, op::Symbol) is called at different times during the worker's lifetime with appropriate op values:with :register/:deregister when a worker is added / removed from the Julia worker pool.\nwith :interrupt when interrupt(workers) is called. The ClusterManager should signal the appropriate worker with an interrupt signal.\nwith :finalize for cleanup purposes."

For example, consider a Julia cluster of 32 processes in an all-to-all mesh network:Each Julia process thus has 31 communication tasks.\nEach task handles all incoming messages from a single remote worker in a message-processing loop.\nThe message-processing loop waits on an IO object (for example, a TCPSocket in the default implementation), reads an entire message, processes it and waits for the next one.\nSending messages to a process is done directly from any Julia task–not just communication tasks–again, via the appropriate IO object.Replacing the default transport requires the new implementation to set up connections to remote workers and to provide appropriate IO objects that the message-processing loops can wait on. The manager-specific callbacks to be implemented are:connect(manager::FooManager, pid::Integer, config::WorkerConfig)\nkill(manager::FooManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)The default implementation (which uses TCP/IP sockets) is implemented as connect(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Integer, config::WorkerConfig).connect should return a pair of IO objects, one for reading data sent from worker pid, and the other to write data that needs to be sent to worker pid. Custom cluster managers can use an in-memory BufferStream as the plumbing to proxy data between the custom, possibly non-IO transport and Julia's in-built parallel infrastructure.A BufferStream is an in-memory IOBuffer which behaves like an IO–it is a stream which can be handled asynchronously.Folder examples/clustermanager/0mq contains an example of using ZeroMQ to connect Julia workers in a star topology with a 0MQ broker in the middle. Note: The Julia processes are still all logically connected to each other–any worker can message any other worker directly without any awareness of 0MQ being used as the transport layer.When using custom transports:Julia workers must NOT be started with --worker. Starting with --worker will result in the newly launched workers defaulting to the TCP/IP socket transport implementation.\nFor every incoming logical connection with a worker, Base.process_messages(rd::IO, wr::IO)() must be called. This launches a new task that handles reading and writing of messages from/to the worker represented by the IO objects.\ninit_worker(cookie, manager::FooManager) MUST be called as part of worker process initialization.\nField connect_at::Any in WorkerConfig can be set by the cluster manager when launch() is called. The value of this field is passed in in all connect() callbacks. Typically, it carries information on how to connect to a worker. For example, the TCP/IP socket transport uses this field to specify the (host, port) tuple at which to connect to a worker.kill(manager, pid, config) is called to remove a worker from the cluster. On the master process, the corresponding IO objects must be closed by the implementation to ensure proper cleanup. The default implementation simply executes an exit() call on the specified remote worker.examples/clustermanager/simple is an example that shows a simple implementation using UNIX domain sockets for cluster setup."

    "text": "Julia clusters are designed to be executed on already secured environments on infrastructure such as local laptops, departmental clusters, or even the cloud. This section covers network security requirements for the inbuilt LocalManager and SSHManager:The master process does not listen on any port. It only connects out to the workers.\nEach worker binds to only one of the local interfaces and listens on an ephemeral port number assigned by the OS.\nLocalManager, used by addprocs(N), by default binds only to the loopback interface. This means that workers started later on remote hosts (or by anyone with malicious intentions) are unable to connect to the cluster. An addprocs(4) followed by an addprocs([\"remote_host\"]) will fail. Some users may need to create a cluster comprising their local system and a few remote systems. This can be done by explicitly requesting LocalManager to bind to an external network interface via the restrict keyword argument: addprocs(4; restrict=false).\nSSHManager, used by addprocs(list_of_remote_hosts), launches workers on remote hosts via SSH. By default SSH is only used to launch Julia workers. Subsequent master-worker and worker-worker connections use plain, unencrypted TCP/IP sockets. The remote hosts must have passwordless login enabled. Additional SSH flags or credentials may be specified via keyword argument sshflags.\naddprocs(list_of_remote_hosts; tunnel=true, sshflags=<ssh keys and other flags>) is useful when we wish to use SSH connections for master-worker too. A typical scenario for this is a local laptop running the Julia REPL (i.e., the master) with the rest of the cluster on the cloud, say on Amazon EC2. In this case only port 22 needs to be opened at the remote cluster coupled with SSH client authenticated via public key infrastructure (PKI). Authentication credentials can be supplied via sshflags, for example sshflags=`-e <keyfile>`.\nIn an all-to-all topology (the default), all workers connect to each other via plain TCP sockets. The security policy on the cluster nodes must thus ensure free connectivity between workers for the ephemeral port range (varies by OS).\nSecuring and encrypting all worker-worker traffic (via SSH) or encrypting individual messages can be done via a custom ClusterManager."

Custom ClusterManagers can retrieve the cookie on the master by calling Base.cluster_cookie(). Cluster managers not using the default TCP/IP transport (and hence not specifying --worker) must call init_worker(cookie, manager) with the same cookie as on the master.Note that environments requiring higher levels of security can implement this via a custom ClusterManager. For example, cookies can be pre-shared and hence not specified as a startup argument."

A patched version of libuv (http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/) provides this functionality. Yield points provide for co-operatively scheduling multiple tasks onto the same OS thread. I/O tasks and timers yield implicitly while waiting for the event to occur. Calling yield() explicitly allows for other tasks to be scheduled.Thus, a task executing a ccall effectively prevents the Julia scheduler from executing any other tasks till the call returns. This is true for all calls into external libraries. Exceptions are calls into custom C code that call back into Julia (which may then yield) or C code that calls jl_yield() (C equivalent of yield()).Note that while Julia code runs on a single thread (by default), libraries used by Julia may launch their own internal threads. For example, the BLAS library may start as many threads as there are cores on a machine.The @threadcall macro addresses scenarios where we do not want a ccall to block the main Julia event loop. It schedules a C function for execution in a separate thread. A threadpool with a default size of 4 is used for this. The size of the threadpool is controlled via environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE. While waiting for a free thread, and during function execution once a thread is available, the requesting task (on the main Julia event loop) yields to other tasks. Note that @threadcall does not return till the execution is complete. From a user point of view, it is therefore a blocking call like other Julia APIs.It is very important that the called function does not call back into Julia.@threadcall may be removed/changed in future versions of Julia.[1]: In this context, MPI refers to the MPI-1 standard. Beginning with MPI-2, the MPI standards committee introduced a new set of communication mechanisms, collectively referred to as Remote Memory Access (RMA). The motivation for adding RMA to the MPI standard was to facilitate one-sided communication patterns. For additional information on the latest MPI standard, see http://mpi-forum.org/docs."

    "text": "CurrentModule = Base.DatesThe Dates module provides two types for working with dates: Date and DateTime, representing day and millisecond precision, respectively; both are subtypes of the abstract TimeType. The motivation for distinct types is simple: some operations are much simpler, both in terms of code and mental reasoning, when the complexities of greater precision don't have to be dealt with. For example, since the Date type only resolves to the precision of a single date (i.e. no hours, minutes, or seconds), normal considerations for time zones, daylight savings/summer time, and leap seconds are unnecessary and avoided.Both Date and DateTime are basically immutable Int64 wrappers. The single instant field of either type is actually a UTInstant{P} type, which represents a continuously increasing machine timeline based on the UT second [1]. The DateTime type is not aware of time zones (naive, in Python parlance), analogous to a LocalDateTime in Java 8. Additional time zone functionality can be added through the TimeZones.jl package, which compiles the IANA time zone database. Both Date and DateTime are based on the ISO 8601 standard, which follows the proleptic Gregorian calendar. One note is that the ISO 8601 standard is particular about BC/BCE dates. In general, the last day of the BC/BCE era, 1-12-31 BC/BCE, was followed by 1-1-1 AD/CE, thus no year zero exists. The ISO standard, however, states that 1 BC/BCE is year zero, so 0000-12-31 is the day before 0001-01-01, and year -0001 (yes, negative one for the year) is 2 BC/BCE, year -0002 is 3 BC/BCE, etc.[1]: The notion of the UT second is actually quite fundamental. There are basically two different notions of time generally accepted, one based on the physical rotation of the earth (one full rotation = 1 day), the other based on the SI second (a fixed, constant value). These are radically different! Think about it, a \"UT second\", as defined relative to the rotation of the earth, may have a different absolute length depending on the day! Anyway, the fact that Date and DateTime are based on UT seconds is a simplifying, yet honest assumption so that things like leap seconds and all their complexity can be avoided. This basis of time is formally called UT or UT1. Basing types on the UT second basically means that every minute has 60 seconds and every day has 24 hours and leads to more natural calculations when working with calendar dates."

Format strings work by the notion of defining delimited or fixed-width \"slots\" that contain a period to parse and passing the text to parse and format string to a Date or DateTime constructor, of the form Date(\"2015-01-01\",\"y-m-d\") or DateTime(\"20150101\",\"yyyymmdd\").Delimited slots are marked by specifying the delimiter the parser should expect between two subsequent periods; so \"y-m-d\" lets the parser know that between the first and second slots in a date string like \"2014-07-16\", it should find the - character. The y, m, and d characters let the parser know which periods to parse in each slot.Fixed-width slots are specified by repeating the period character the number of times corresponding to the width with no delimiter between characters. So \"yyyymmdd\" would correspond to a date string like \"20140716\". The parser distinguishes a fixed-width slot by the absence of a delimiter, noting the transition \"yyyymm\" from one period character to the next.Support for text-form month parsing is also supported through the u and U characters, for abbreviated and full-length month names, respectively. By default, only English month names are supported, so u corresponds to \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", etc. And U corresponds to \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", etc. Similar to other name=>value mapping functions dayname() and monthname(), custom locales can be loaded by passing in the locale=>Dict{String,Int} mapping to the MONTHTOVALUEABBR and MONTHTOVALUE dicts for abbreviated and full-name month names, respectively.One note on parsing performance: using the Date(date_string,format_string) function is fine if only called a few times. If there are many similarly formatted date strings to parse however, it is much more efficient to first create a Dates.DateFormat, and pass it instead of a raw format string.julia> df = DateFormat(\"y-m-d\");\n\njulia> dt = Date(\"2015-01-01\",df)\n2015-01-01\n\njulia> dt2 = Date(\"2015-01-02\",df)\n2015-01-02You can also use the dateformat\"\" string macro. This macro creates the DateFormat object once when the macro is expanded and uses the same DateFormat object even if a code snippet is run multiple times.julia> for i = 1:10^5\n           Date(\"2015-01-01\", dateformat\"y-m-d\")\n       endA full suite of parsing and formatting tests and examples is available in tests/dates/io.jl."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "It's good practice when using any language/date framework to be familiar with how date-period arithmetic is handled as there are some tricky issues to deal with (though much less so for day-precision types).The Dates module approach tries to follow the simple principle of trying to change as little as possible when doing Period arithmetic. This approach is also often known as calendrical arithmetic or what you would probably guess if someone were to ask you the same calculation in a conversation. Why all the fuss about this? Let's take a classic example: add 1 month to January 31st, 2014. What's the answer? Javascript will say March 3 (assumes 31 days). PHP says March 2 (assumes 30 days). The fact is, there is no right answer. In the Dates module, it gives the result of February 28th. How does it figure that out? I like to think of the classic 7-7-7 gambling game in casinos.Now just imagine that instead of 7-7-7, the slots are Year-Month-Day, or in our example, 2014-01-31. When you ask to add 1 month to this date, the month slot is incremented, so now we have 2014-02-31. Then the day number is checked if it is greater than the last valid day of the new month; if it is (as in the case above), the day number is adjusted down to the last valid day (28). What are the ramifications with this approach? Go ahead and add another month to our date, 2014-02-28 + Month(1) == 2014-03-28. What? Were you expecting the last day of March? Nope, sorry, remember the 7-7-7 slots. As few slots as possible are going to change, so we first increment the month slot by 1, 2014-03-28, and boom, we're done because that's a valid date. On the other hand, if we were to add 2 months to our original date, 2014-01-31, then we end up with 2014-03-31, as expected. The other ramification of this approach is a loss in associativity when a specific ordering is forced (i.e. adding things in different orders results in different outcomes). For example:julia> (Date(2014,1,29)+Dates.Day(1)) + Dates.Month(1)\n2014-02-28\n\njulia> (Date(2014,1,29)+Dates.Month(1)) + Dates.Day(1)\n2014-03-01What's going on there? In the first line, we're adding 1 day to January 29th, which results in 2014-01-30; then we add 1 month, so we get 2014-02-30, which then adjusts down to 2014-02-28. In the second example, we add 1 month first, where we get 2014-02-29, which adjusts down to 2014-02-28, and then add 1 day, which results in 2014-03-01. One design principle that helps in this case is that, in the presence of multiple Periods, the operations will be ordered by the Periods' types, not their value or positional order; this means Year will always be added first, then Month, then Week, etc. Hence the following does result in associativity and Just Works:julia> Date(2014,1,29) + Dates.Day(1) + Dates.Month(1)\n2014-03-01\n\njulia> Date(2014,1,29) + Dates.Month(1) + Dates.Day(1)\n2014-03-01Tricky? Perhaps. What is an innocent Dates user to do? The bottom line is to be aware that explicitly forcing a certain associativity, when dealing with months, may lead to some unexpected results, but otherwise, everything should work as expected. Thankfully, that's pretty much the extent of the odd cases in date-period arithmetic when dealing with time in UT (avoiding the \"joys\" of dealing with daylight savings, leap seconds, etc.).As a bonus, all period arithmetic objects work directly with ranges:julia> dr = Date(2014,1,29):Date(2014,2,3)\n2014-01-29:1 day:2014-02-03\n\njulia> collect(dr)\n6-element Array{Date,1}:\n 2014-01-29\n 2014-01-30\n 2014-01-31\n 2014-02-01\n 2014-02-02\n 2014-02-03\n\njulia> dr = Date(2014,1,29):Dates.Month(1):Date(2014,07,29)\n2014-01-29:1 month:2014-07-29\n\njulia> collect(dr)\n7-element Array{Date,1}:\n 2014-01-29\n 2014-02-28\n 2014-03-29\n 2014-04-29\n 2014-05-29\n 2014-06-29\n 2014-07-29"

    "category": "section",
    "text": "As convenient as date-period arithmetics are, often the kinds of calculations needed on dates take on a calendrical or temporal nature rather than a fixed number of periods. Holidays are a perfect example; most follow rules such as \"Memorial Day = Last Monday of May\", or \"Thanksgiving = 4th Thursday of November\". These kinds of temporal expressions deal with rules relative to the calendar, like first or last of the month, next Tuesday, or the first and third Wednesdays, etc.The Dates module provides the adjuster API through several convenient methods that aid in simply and succinctly expressing temporal rules. The first group of adjuster methods deal with the first and last of weeks, months, quarters, and years. They each take a single TimeType as input and return or adjust to the first or last of the desired period relative to the input.julia> Dates.firstdayofweek(Date(2014,7,16)) # Adjusts the input to the Monday of the input's week\n2014-07-14\n\njulia> Dates.lastdayofmonth(Date(2014,7,16)) # Adjusts to the last day of the input's month\n2014-07-31\n\njulia> Dates.lastdayofquarter(Date(2014,7,16)) # Adjusts to the last day of the input's quarter\n2014-09-30The next two higher-order methods, tonext(), and toprev(), generalize working with temporal expressions by taking a DateFunction as first argument, along with a starting TimeType. A DateFunction is just a function, usually anonymous, that takes a single TimeType as input and returns a Bool, true indicating a satisfied adjustment criterion. For example:julia> istuesday = x->Dates.dayofweek(x) == Dates.Tuesday # Returns true if the day of the week of x is Tuesday\n(::#1) (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> Dates.tonext(istuesday, Date(2014,7,13)) # 2014-07-13 is a Sunday\n2014-07-15\n\njulia> Dates.tonext(Date(2014,7,13), Dates.Tuesday) # Convenience method provided for day of the week adjustments\n2014-07-15This is useful with the do-block syntax for more complex temporal expressions:julia> Dates.tonext(Date(2014,7,13)) do x\n           # Return true on the 4th Thursday of November (Thanksgiving)\n           Dates.dayofweek(x) == Dates.Thursday &&\n           Dates.dayofweekofmonth(x) == 4 &&\n           Dates.month(x) == Dates.November\n       end\n2014-11-27The Base.filter() method can be used to obtain all valid dates/moments in a specified range:# Pittsburgh street cleaning; Every 2nd Tuesday from April to November\n# Date range from January 1st, 2014 to January 1st, 2015\njulia> dr = Dates.Date(2014):Dates.Date(2015);\n\njulia> filter(dr) do x\n           Dates.dayofweek(x) == Dates.Tue &&\n           Dates.April <= Dates.month(x) <= Dates.Nov &&\n           Dates.dayofweekofmonth(x) == 2\n       end\n8-element Array{Date,1}:\n 2014-04-08\n 2014-05-13\n 2014-06-10\n 2014-07-08\n 2014-08-12\n 2014-09-09\n 2014-10-14\n 2014-11-11Additional examples and tests are available in test/dates/adjusters.jl."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "In many cases, the resolution specified for rounding (e.g., Dates.Second(30)) divides evenly into the next largest period (in this case, Dates.Minute(1)). But rounding behaviour in cases in which this is not true may lead to confusion. What is the expected result of rounding a DateTime to the nearest 10 hours?julia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 11, 55), Dates.Hour(10))\n2016-07-17T12:00:00That may seem confusing, given that the hour (12) is not divisible by 10. The reason that 2016-07-17T12:00:00 was chosen is that it is 17,676,660 hours after 0000-01-01T00:00:00, and 17,676,660 is divisible by 10.As Julia Date and DateTime values are represented according to the ISO 8601 standard, 0000-01-01T00:00:00 was chosen as base (or \"rounding epoch\") from which to begin the count of days (and milliseconds) used in rounding calculations. (Note that this differs slightly from Julia's internal representation of Date s using Rata Die notation; but since the ISO 8601 standard is most visible to the end user, 0000-01-01T00:00:00 was chosen as the rounding epoch instead of the 0000-12-31T00:00:00 used internally to minimize confusion.)The only exception to the use of 0000-01-01T00:00:00 as the rounding epoch is when rounding to weeks. Rounding to the nearest week will always return a Monday (the first day of the week as specified by ISO 8601). For this reason, we use 0000-01-03T00:00:00 (the first day of the first week of year 0000, as defined by ISO 8601) as the base when rounding to a number of weeks.Here is a related case in which the expected behaviour is not necessarily obvious: What happens when we round to the nearest P(2), where P is a Period type? In some cases (specifically, when P <: Dates.TimePeriod) the answer is clear:julia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 8, 55, 30), Dates.Hour(2))\n2016-07-17T08:00:00\n\njulia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 8, 55, 30), Dates.Minute(2))\n2016-07-17T08:56:00This seems obvious, because two of each of these periods still divides evenly into the next larger order period. But in the case of two months (which still divides evenly into one year), the answer may be surprising:julia> round(DateTime(2016, 7, 17, 8, 55, 30), Dates.Month(2))\n2016-07-01T00:00:00Why round to the first day in July, even though it is month 7 (an odd number)? The key is that months are 1-indexed (the first month is assigned 1), unlike hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (the first of which are assigned 0).This means that rounding a DateTime to an even multiple of seconds, minutes, hours, or years (because the ISO 8601 specification includes a year zero) will result in a DateTime with an even value in that field, while rounding a DateTime to an even multiple of months will result in the months field having an odd value. Because both months and years may contain an irregular number of days, whether rounding to an even number of days will result in an even value in the days field is uncertain.See the API reference for additional information on methods exported from the Dates module."

However, in Julia, writingjulia> `echo hello`\n`echo hello`differs in several aspects from the behavior in various shells, Perl, or Ruby:Instead of immediately running the command, backticks create a Cmd object to represent the command. You can use this object to connect the command to others via pipes, run it, and read or write to it.\nWhen the command is run, Julia does not capture its output unless you specifically arrange for it to. Instead, the output of the command by default goes to STDOUT as it would using libc's system call.\nThe command is never run with a shell. Instead, Julia parses the command syntax directly, appropriately interpolating variables and splitting on words as the shell would, respecting shell quoting syntax. The command is run as julia's immediate child process, using fork and exec calls.Here's a simple example of running an external program:julia> mycommand = `echo hello`\n`echo hello`\n\njulia> typeof(mycommand)\nCmd\n\njulia> run(mycommand)\nhelloThe hello is the output of the echo command, sent to STDOUT. The run method itself returns nothing, and throws an ErrorException if the external command fails to run successfully.If you want to read the output of the external command, readstring() can be used instead:julia> a = readstring(`echo hello`)\n\"hello\\n\"\n\njulia> chomp(a) == \"hello\"\ntrueMore generally, you can use open() to read from or write to an external command.julia> open(`less`, \"w\", STDOUT) do io\n           for i = 1:3\n               println(io, i)\n           end\n       end\n1\n2\n3The program name and the individual arguments in a command can be accessed and iterated over as if the command were an array of strings:julia> collect(`echo \"foo bar\"`)\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"echo\"\n \"foo bar\"\n\njulia> `echo \"foo bar\"`[2]\n\"foo bar\""

    "text": "Suppose you want to do something a bit more complicated and use the name of a file in the variable file as an argument to a command. You can use $ for interpolation much as you would in a string literal (see Strings):julia> file = \"/etc/passwd\"\n\"/etc/passwd\"\n\njulia> `sort $file`\n`sort /etc/passwd`A common pitfall when running external programs via a shell is that if a file name contains characters that are special to the shell, they may cause undesirable behavior. Suppose, for example, rather than /etc/passwd, we wanted to sort the contents of the file /Volumes/External HD/data.csv. Let's try it:julia> file = \"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"\n\"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"\n\njulia> `sort $file`\n`sort '/Volumes/External HD/data.csv'`How did the file name get quoted? Julia knows that file is meant to be interpolated as a single argument, so it quotes the word for you. Actually, that is not quite accurate: the value of file is never interpreted by a shell, so there's no need for actual quoting; the quotes are inserted only for presentation to the user. This will even work if you interpolate a value as part of a shell word:julia> path = \"/Volumes/External HD\"\n\"/Volumes/External HD\"\n\njulia> name = \"data\"\n\"data\"\n\njulia> ext = \"csv\"\n\"csv\"\n\njulia> `sort $path/$name.$ext`\n`sort '/Volumes/External HD/data.csv'`As you can see, the space in the path variable is appropriately escaped. But what if you want to interpolate multiple words? In that case, just use an array (or any other iterable container):julia> files = [\"/etc/passwd\",\"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"]\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"/etc/passwd\"\n \"/Volumes/External HD/data.csv\"\n\njulia> `grep foo $files`\n`grep foo /etc/passwd '/Volumes/External HD/data.csv'`If you interpolate an array as part of a shell word, Julia emulates the shell's {a,b,c} argument generation:julia> names = [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"foo\"\n \"bar\"\n \"baz\"\n\njulia> `grep xylophone $names.txt`\n`grep xylophone foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt`Moreover, if you interpolate multiple arrays into the same word, the shell's Cartesian product generation behavior is emulated:julia> names = [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"foo\"\n \"bar\"\n \"baz\"\n\njulia> exts = [\"aux\",\"log\"]\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"aux\"\n \"log\"\n\njulia> `rm -f $names.$exts`\n`rm -f foo.aux foo.log bar.aux bar.log baz.aux baz.log`Since you can interpolate literal arrays, you can use this generative functionality without needing to create temporary array objects first:julia> `rm -rf $[\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\",\"qux\"].$[\"aux\",\"log\",\"pdf\"]`\n`rm -rf foo.aux foo.log foo.pdf bar.aux bar.log bar.pdf baz.aux baz.log baz.pdf qux.aux qux.log qux.pdf`"

Here's a simple example of a Perl one-liner at a shell prompt:sh$ perl -le '$|=1; for (0..3) { print }'\n0\n1\n2\n3The Perl expression needs to be in single quotes for two reasons: so that spaces don't break the expression into multiple shell words, and so that uses of Perl variables like $| (yes, that's the name of a variable in Perl), don't cause interpolation. In other instances, you may want to use double quotes so that interpolation does occur:sh$ first=\"A\"\nsh$ second=\"B\"\nsh$ perl -le '$|=1; print for @ARGV' \"1: $first\" \"2: $second\"\n1: A\n2: BIn general, the Julia backtick syntax is carefully designed so that you can just cut-and-paste shell commands as is into backticks and they will work: the escaping, quoting, and interpolation behaviors are the same as the shell's. The only difference is that the interpolation is integrated and aware of Julia's notion of what is a single string value, and what is a container for multiple values. Let's try the above two examples in Julia:julia> A = `perl -le '$|=1; for (0..3) { print }'`\n`perl -le '$|=1; for (0..3) { print }'`\n\njulia> run(A)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\njulia> first = \"A\"; second = \"B\";\n\njulia> B = `perl -le 'print for @ARGV' \"1: $first\" \"2: $second\"`\n`perl -le 'print for @ARGV' '1: A' '2: B'`\n\njulia> run(B)\n1: A\n2: BThe results are identical, and Julia's interpolation behavior mimics the shell's with some improvements due to the fact that Julia supports first-class iterable objects while most shells use strings split on spaces for this, which introduces ambiguities. When trying to port shell commands to Julia, try cut and pasting first. Since Julia shows commands to you before running them, you can easily and safely just examine its interpretation without doing any damage."

The result is that a single line is printed: hello | sort. How, then, does one construct a pipeline? Instead of using '|' inside of backticks, one uses pipeline():julia> run(pipeline(`echo hello`, `sort`))\nhelloThis pipes the output of the echo command to the sort command. Of course, this isn't terribly interesting since there's only one line to sort, but we can certainly do much more interesting things:julia> run(pipeline(`cut -d: -f3 /etc/passwd`, `sort -n`, `tail -n5`))\n210\n211\n212\n213\n214This prints the highest five user IDs on a UNIX system. The cut, sort and tail commands are all spawned as immediate children of the current julia process, with no intervening shell process. Julia itself does the work to setup pipes and connect file descriptors that is normally done by the shell. Since Julia does this itself, it retains better control and can do some things that shells cannot.Julia can run multiple commands in parallel:julia> run(`echo hello` & `echo world`)\nworld\nhelloThe order of the output here is non-deterministic because the two echo processes are started nearly simultaneously, and race to make the first write to the STDOUT descriptor they share with each other and the julia parent process. Julia lets you pipe the output from both of these processes to another program:julia> run(pipeline(`echo world` & `echo hello`, `sort`))\nhello\nworldIn terms of UNIX plumbing, what's happening here is that a single UNIX pipe object is created and written to by both echo processes, and the other end of the pipe is read from by the sort command.IO redirection can be accomplished by passing keyword arguments stdin, stdout, and stderr to the pipeline function:pipeline(`do_work`, stdout=pipeline(`sort`, \"out.txt\"), stderr=\"errs.txt\")"

(Setting $|=1 in Perl causes each print statement to flush the STDOUT handle, which is necessary for this example to work. Otherwise all the output is buffered and printed to the pipe at once, to be read by just one consumer process.)Here is an even more complex multi-stage producer-consumer example:julia> run(pipeline(`perl -le '$|=1; for(0..9){ print; sleep 1 }'`,\n           prefixer(\"X\",3) & prefixer(\"Y\",3) & prefixer(\"Z\",3),\n           prefixer(\"A\",2) & prefixer(\"B\",2)))\nA X 0\nB Y 1\nA Z 2\nB X 3\nA Y 4\nB Z 5\nA X 6\nB Y 7\nA Z 8\nB X 9This example is similar to the previous one, except there are two stages of consumers, and the stages have different latency so they use a different number of parallel workers, to maintain saturated throughput.We strongly encourage you to try all these examples to see how they work."

    "text": "Though most code can be written in Julia, there are many high-quality, mature libraries for numerical computing already written in C and Fortran. To allow easy use of this existing code, Julia makes it simple and efficient to call C and Fortran functions. Julia has a \"no boilerplate\" philosophy: functions can be called directly from Julia without any \"glue\" code, code generation, or compilation – even from the interactive prompt. This is accomplished just by making an appropriate call with ccall syntax, which looks like an ordinary function call.The code to be called must be available as a shared library. Most C and Fortran libraries ship compiled as shared libraries already, but if you are compiling the code yourself using GCC (or Clang), you will need to use the -shared and -fPIC options. The machine instructions generated by Julia's JIT are the same as a native C call would be, so the resulting overhead is the same as calling a library function from C code. (Non-library function calls in both C and Julia can be inlined and thus may have even less overhead than calls to shared library functions. When both libraries and executables are generated by LLVM, it is possible to perform whole-program optimizations that can even optimize across this boundary, but Julia does not yet support that. In the future, however, it may do so, yielding even greater performance gains.)Shared libraries and functions are referenced by a tuple of the form (:function, \"library\") or (\"function\", \"library\") where function is the C-exported function name. library refers to the shared library name: shared libraries available in the (platform-specific) load path will be resolved by name, and if necessary a direct path may be specified.A function name may be used alone in place of the tuple (just :function or \"function\"). In this case the name is resolved within the current process. This form can be used to call C library functions, functions in the Julia runtime, or functions in an application linked to Julia.By default, Fortran compilers generate mangled names (for example, converting function names to lowercase or uppercase, often appending an underscore), and so to call a Fortran function via ccall you must pass the mangled identifier corresponding to the rule followed by your Fortran compiler.  Also, when calling a Fortran function, all inputs must be passed by reference.Finally, you can use ccall to actually generate a call to the library function. Arguments to ccall are as follows:A (:function, \"library\") pair, which must be written as a literal constant,\nOR\na function pointer (for example, from dlsym).\nReturn type (see below for mapping the declared C type to Julia)\nThis argument will be evaluated at compile-time, when the containing method is defined.\nA tuple of input types. The input types must be written as a literal tuple, not a tuple-valued variable or expression.\nThis argument will be evaluated at compile-time, when the containing method is defined.\nThe following arguments, if any, are the actual argument values passed to the function.As a complete but simple example, the following calls the clock function from the standard C library:julia> t = ccall((:clock, \"libc\"), Int32, ())\n2292761\n\njulia> t\n2292761\n\njulia> typeof(ans)\nInt32clock takes no arguments and returns an Int32. One common gotcha is that a 1-tuple must be written with a trailing comma. For example, to call the getenv function to get a pointer to the value of an environment variable, one makes a call like this:julia> path = ccall((:getenv, \"libc\"), Cstring, (Cstring,), \"SHELL\")\nCstring(@0x00007fff5fbffc45)\n\njulia> unsafe_string(path)\n\"/bin/bash\"Note that the argument type tuple must be written as (Cstring,), rather than (Cstring). This is because (Cstring) is just the expression Cstring surrounded by parentheses, rather than a 1-tuple containing Cstring:julia> (Cstring)\nCstring\n\njulia> (Cstring,)\n(Cstring,)In practice, especially when providing reusable functionality, one generally wraps ccall uses in Julia functions that set up arguments and then check for errors in whatever manner the C or Fortran function indicates them, propagating to the Julia caller as exceptions. This is especially important since C and Fortran APIs are notoriously inconsistent about how they indicate error conditions. For example, the getenv C library function is wrapped in the following Julia function, which is a simplified version of the actual definition from env.jl:function getenv(var::AbstractString)\n    val = ccall((:getenv, \"libc\"),\n                Cstring, (Cstring,), var)\n    if val == C_NULL\n        error(\"getenv: undefined variable: \", var)\n    end\n    unsafe_string(val)\nendThe C getenv function indicates an error by returning NULL, but other standard C functions indicate errors in various different ways, including by returning -1, 0, 1 and other special values. This wrapper throws an exception clearly indicating the problem if the caller tries to get a non-existent environment variable:julia> getenv(\"SHELL\")\n\"/bin/bash\"\n\njulia> getenv(\"FOOBAR\")\ngetenv: undefined variable: FOOBARHere is a slightly more complex example that discovers the local machine's hostname:function gethostname()\n    hostname = Vector{UInt8}(128)\n    ccall((:gethostname, \"libc\"), Int32,\n          (Ptr{UInt8}, Csize_t),\n          hostname, sizeof(hostname))\n    hostname[end] = 0; # ensure null-termination\n    return unsafe_string(pointer(hostname))\nendThis example first allocates an array of bytes, then calls the C library function gethostname to fill the array in with the hostname, takes a pointer to the hostname buffer, and converts the pointer to a Julia string, assuming that it is a NUL-terminated C string. It is common for C libraries to use this pattern of requiring the caller to allocate memory to be passed to the callee and filled in. Allocation of memory from Julia like this is generally accomplished by creating an uninitialized array and passing a pointer to its data to the C function. This is why we don't use the Cstring type here: as the array is uninitialized, it could contain NUL bytes. Converting to a Cstring as part of the ccall checks for contained NUL bytes and could therefore throw a conversion error."

For example, to match C prototypes of the form:typedef returntype (*functiontype)(argumenttype,...)The function cfunction() generates the C-compatible function pointer for a call to a Julia library function. Arguments to cfunction() are as follows:A Julia Function\nReturn type\nA tuple of input typesA classic example is the standard C library qsort function, declared as:void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,\n           int(*compare)(const void *a, const void *b));The base argument is a pointer to an array of length nmemb, with elements of size bytes each. compare is a callback function which takes pointers to two elements a and b and returns an integer less/greater than zero if a should appear before/after b (or zero if any order is permitted). Now, suppose that we have a 1d array A of values in Julia that we want to sort using the qsort function (rather than Julia's built-in sort function). Before we worry about calling qsort and passing arguments, we need to write a comparison function that works for some arbitrary type T:julia> function mycompare(a::T, b::T) where T\n           return convert(Cint, a < b ? -1 : a > b ? +1 : 0)::Cint\n       end\nmycompare (generic function with 1 method)Notice that we have to be careful about the return type: qsort expects a function returning a C int, so we must be sure to return Cint via a call to convert and a typeassert.In order to pass this function to C, we obtain its address using the function cfunction:julia> const mycompare_c = cfunction(mycompare, Cint, (Ref{Cdouble}, Ref{Cdouble}));cfunction() accepts three arguments: the Julia function (mycompare), the return type (Cint), and a tuple of the argument types, in this case to sort an array of Cdouble (Float64) elements.The final call to qsort looks like this:julia> A = [1.3, -2.7, 4.4, 3.1]\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  1.3\n -2.7\n  4.4\n  3.1\n\njulia> ccall(:qsort, Void, (Ptr{Cdouble}, Csize_t, Csize_t, Ptr{Void}),\n             A, length(A), sizeof(eltype(A)), mycompare_c)\n\njulia> A\n4-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.7\n  1.3\n  3.1\n  4.4As can be seen, A is changed to the sorted array [-2.7, 1.3, 3.1, 4.4]. Note that Julia knows how to convert an array into a Ptr{Cdouble}, how to compute the size of a type in bytes (identical to C's sizeof operator), and so on. For fun, try inserting a println(\"mycompare($a,$b)\") line into mycompare, which will allow you to see the comparisons that qsort is performing (and to verify that it is really calling the Julia function that you passed to it)."

Cstring can also be used as the ccall return type, but in that case it obviously does not introduce any extra checks and is only meant to improve readability of the call.System-dependent:C name Standard Julia Alias Julia Base Type\nchar Cchar Int8 (x86, x86_64), UInt8 (powerpc, arm)\nlong Clong Int (UNIX), Int32 (Windows)\nunsigned long Culong UInt (UNIX), UInt32 (Windows)\nwchar_t Cwchar_t Int32 (UNIX), UInt16 (Windows)note: Note\nWhen calling a Fortran function, all inputs must be passed by reference, so all type correspondences above should contain an additional Ptr{..} or Ref{..} wrapper around their type specification.warning: Warning\nFor string arguments (char*) the Julia type should be Cstring (if NUL- terminated data is expected) or either Ptr{Cchar} or Ptr{UInt8} otherwise (these two pointer types have the same effect), as described above, not String. Similarly, for array arguments (T[] or T*), the Julia type should again be Ptr{T}, not Vector{T}.warning: Warning\nJulia's Char type is 32 bits, which is not the same as the wide character type (wchar_t or wint_t) on all platforms.warning: Warning\nA return type of Union{} means the function will not return i.e. C++11 [[noreturn]] or C11 _Noreturn (e.g. jl_throw or longjmp). Do not use this for functions that return no value (void) but do return, use Void instead.note: Note\nFor wchar_t* arguments, the Julia type should be Cwstring (if the C routine expects a NUL-terminated string) or Ptr{Cwchar_t} otherwise. Note also that UTF-8 string data in Julia is internally NUL-terminated, so it can be passed to C functions expecting NUL-terminated data without making a copy (but using the Cwstring type will cause an error to be thrown if the string itself contains NUL characters).note: Note\nC functions that take an argument of the type char** can be called by using a Ptr{Ptr{UInt8}} type within Julia. For example, C functions of the form:int main(int argc, char **argv);can be called via the following Julia code:argv = [ \"a.out\", \"arg1\", \"arg2\" ]\nccall(:main, Int32, (Int32, Ptr{Ptr{UInt8}}), length(argv), argv)note: Note\nA C function declared to return Void will return the value nothing in Julia."

All other types are stored as a pointer to the data. When mirroring a struct used by-value inside another struct in C, it is imperative that you do not attempt to manually copy the fields over, as this will not preserve the correct field alignment. Instead, declare an isbits struct type and use that instead. Unnamed structs are not possible in the translation to Julia.Packed structs and union declarations are not supported by Julia.You can get a near approximation of a union if you know, a priori, the field that will have the greatest size (potentially including padding). When translating your fields to Julia, declare the Julia field to be only of that type.Arrays of parameters can be expressed with NTuple:in C:\nstruct B {\n    int A[3];\n};\nb_a_2 = B.A[2];\n\nin Julia:\nstruct B\n    A::NTuple{3, CInt}\nend\nb_a_2 = B.A[3]  # note the difference in indexing (1-based in Julia, 0-based in C)Arrays of unknown size (C99-compliant variable length structs specified by [] or [0]) are not directly supported. Often the best way to deal with these is to deal with the byte offsets directly. For example, if a C library declared a proper string type and returned a pointer to it:struct String {\n    int strlen;\n    char data[];\n};In Julia, we can access the parts independently to make a copy of that string:str = from_c::Ptr{Void}\nlen = unsafe_load(Ptr{Cint}(str))\nunsafe_string(str + Core.sizeof(Cint), len)"

The static parameters of the function may be used as type parameters in the ccall signature, as long as they don't affect the layout of the type. For example, f(x::T) where {T} = ccall(:valid, Ptr{T}, (Ptr{T},), x) is valid, since Ptr is always a word-size primitive type.

    "text": "Here is a simple example of a C wrapper that returns a Ptr type:mutable struct gsl_permutation\nend\n\n# The corresponding C signature is\n#     gsl_permutation * gsl_permutation_alloc (size_t n);\nfunction permutation_alloc(n::Integer)\n    output_ptr = ccall(\n        (:gsl_permutation_alloc, :libgsl), # name of C function and library\n        Ptr{gsl_permutation},              # output type\n        (Csize_t,),                        # tuple of input types\n        n                                  # name of Julia variable to pass in\n    )\n    if output_ptr == C_NULL # Could not allocate memory\n        throw(OutOfMemoryError())\n    end\n    return output_ptr\nendThe GNU Scientific Library (here assumed to be accessible through :libgsl) defines an opaque pointer, gsl_permutation *, as the return type of the C function gsl_permutation_alloc(). As user code never has to look inside the gsl_permutation struct, the corresponding Julia wrapper simply needs a new type declaration, gsl_permutation, that has no internal fields and whose sole purpose is to be placed in the type parameter of a Ptr type.  The return type of the ccall is declared as Ptr{gsl_permutation}, since the memory allocated and pointed to by output_ptr is controlled by C (and not Julia).The input n is passed by value, and so the function's input signature is simply declared as (Csize_t,) without any Ref or Ptr necessary. (If the wrapper was calling a Fortran function instead, the corresponding function input signature should instead be (Ref{Csize_t},), since Fortran variables are passed by reference.) Furthermore, n can be any type that is convertable to a Csize_t integer; the ccall implicitly calls Base.cconvert(Csize_t, n).Here is a second example wrapping the corresponding destructor:# The corresponding C signature is\n#     void gsl_permutation_free (gsl_permutation * p);\nfunction permutation_free(p::Ref{gsl_permutation})\n    ccall(\n        (:gsl_permutation_free, :libgsl), # name of C function and library\n        Void,                             # output type\n        (Ref{gsl_permutation},),          # tuple of input types\n        p                                 # name of Julia variable to pass in\n    )\nendHere, the input p is declared to be of type Ref{gsl_permutation}, meaning that the memory that p points to may be managed by Julia or by C. A pointer to memory allocated by C should be of type Ptr{gsl_permutation}, but it is convertable using Base.cconvert() and therefore can be used in the same (covariant) context of the input argument to a ccall. A pointer to memory allocated by Julia must be of type Ref{gsl_permutation}, to ensure that the memory address pointed to is valid and that Julia's garbage collector manages the chunk of memory pointed to correctly. Therefore, the Ref{gsl_permutation} declaration allows pointers managed by C or Julia to be used.If the C wrapper never expects the user to pass pointers to memory managed by Julia, then using p::Ptr{gsl_permutation} for the method signature of the wrapper and similarly in the ccall is also acceptable.Here is a third example passing Julia arrays:# The corresponding C signature is\n#    int gsl_sf_bessel_Jn_array (int nmin, int nmax, double x,\n#                                double result_array[])\nfunction sf_bessel_Jn_array(nmin::Integer, nmax::Integer, x::Real)\n    if nmax < nmin\n        throw(DomainError())\n    end\n    result_array = Vector{Cdouble}(nmax - nmin + 1)\n    errorcode = ccall(\n        (:gsl_sf_bessel_Jn_array, :libgsl), # name of C function and library\n        Cint,                               # output type\n        (Cint, Cint, Cdouble, Ref{Cdouble}),# tuple of input types\n        nmin, nmax, x, result_array         # names of Julia variables to pass in\n    )\n    if errorcode != 0\n        error(\"GSL error code $errorcode\")\n    end\n    return result_array\nendThe C function wrapped returns an integer error code; the results of the actual evaluation of the Bessel J function populate the Julia array result_array. This variable can only be used with corresponding input type declaration Ref{Cdouble}, since its memory is allocated and managed by Julia, not C. The implicit call to Base.cconvert(Ref{Cdouble}, result_array) unpacks the Julia pointer to a Julia array data structure into a form understandable by C.Note that for this code to work correctly, result_array must be declared to be of type Ref{Cdouble} and not Ptr{Cdouble}. The memory is managed by Julia and the Ref signature alerts Julia's garbage collector to keep managing the memory for result_array while the ccall executes. If Ptr{Cdouble} were used instead, the ccall may still work, but Julia's garbage collector would not be aware that the memory declared for result_array is being used by the external C function. As a result, the code may produce a memory leak if result_array never gets freed by the garbage collector, or if the garbage collector prematurely frees result_array, the C function may end up throwing an invalid memory access exception."

    "text": "When passing data to a ccall, it is best to avoid using the pointer() function. Instead define a convert method and pass the variables directly to the ccall. ccall automatically arranges that all of its arguments will be preserved from garbage collection until the call returns. If a C API will store a reference to memory allocated by Julia, after the ccall returns, you must arrange that the object remains visible to the garbage collector. The suggested way to handle this is to make a global variable of type Array{Ref,1} to hold these values, until the C library notifies you that it is finished with them.Whenever you have created a pointer to Julia data, you must ensure the original data exists until you are done with using the pointer. Many methods in Julia such as unsafe_load() and String() make copies of data instead of taking ownership of the buffer, so that it is safe to free (or alter) the original data without affecting Julia. A notable exception is unsafe_wrap() which, for performance reasons, shares (or can be told to take ownership of) the underlying buffer.The garbage collector does not guarantee any order of finalization. That is, if a contained a reference to b and both a and b are due for garbage collection, there is no guarantee that b would be finalized after a.

This function is intentionally similar to the behavior of getindex() and setindex!() (e.g. [] access syntax).The return value will be a new object initialized to contain a copy of the contents of the referenced memory. The referenced memory can safely be freed or released.If T is Any, then the memory is assumed to contain a reference to a Julia object (a jl_value_t*), the result will be a reference to this object, and the object will not be copied. You must be careful in this case to ensure that the object was always visible to the garbage collector (pointers do not count, but the new reference does) to ensure the memory is not prematurely freed. Note that if the object was not originally allocated by Julia, the new object will never be finalized by Julia's garbage collector.

(Julia values v can be converted to jl_value_t* pointers, as Ptr{Void}, by calling pointer_from_objref(v).)The reverse operation (writing data to a Ptr{T}), can be performed using unsafe_store!(ptr, value, [index]). Currently, this is only supported for primitive types or other pointer-free (isbits) immutable struct types.Any operation that throws an error is probably currently unimplemented and should be posted as a bug so that it can be resolved.If the pointer of interest is a plain-data array (primitive type or immutable struct), the function unsafe_wrap(Array, ptr,dims,[own]) may be more useful. The final parameter should be true if Julia should \"take ownership\" of the underlying buffer and call free(ptr) when the returned Array object is finalized.  If the own parameter is omitted or false, the caller must ensure the buffer remains in existence until all access is complete.Arithmetic on the Ptr type in Julia (e.g. using +) does not behave the same as C's pointer arithmetic. Adding an integer to a Ptr in Julia always moves the pointer by some number of bytes, not elements. This way, the address values obtained from pointer arithmetic do not depend on the element types of pointers."

    "text": "Some C libraries execute their callbacks from a different thread, and since Julia isn't thread-safe you'll need to take some extra precautions. In particular, you'll need to set up a two-layered system: the C callback should only schedule (via Julia's event loop) the execution of your \"real\" callback. To do this, create a AsyncCondition object and wait on it:cond = Base.AsyncCondition()\nwait(cond)The callback you pass to C should only execute a ccall to :uv_async_send, passing cond.handle as the argument, taking care to avoid any allocations or other interactions with the Julia runtime.Note that events may be coalesced, so multiple calls to uv_async_send may result in a single wakeup notification to the condition."

The file ui/repl.c program is another simple example of how to set jl_options options while linking against libjulia.The first thing that has to be done before calling any other Julia C function is to initialize Julia. This is done by calling jl_init, which tries to automatically determine Julia's install location. If you need to specify a custom location, or specify which system image to load, use jl_init_with_image instead.The second statement in the test program evaluates a Julia statement using a call to jl_eval_string.Before the program terminates, it is strongly recommended to call jl_atexit_hook.  The above example program calls this before returning from main.note: Note\nCurrently, dynamically linking with the libjulia shared library requires passing the RTLD_GLOBAL option.

Storing simple data types like Float64 in this way is called boxing, and extracting the stored primitive data is called unboxing. Our improved sample program that calculates the square root of 2 in Julia and reads back the result in C looks as follows:jl_value_t *ret = jl_eval_string(\"sqrt(2.0)\");\n\nif (jl_typeis(ret, jl_float64_type)) {\n    double ret_unboxed = jl_unbox_float64(ret);\n    printf(\"sqrt(2.0) in C: %e \\n\", ret_unboxed);\n}\nelse {\n    printf(\"ERROR: unexpected return type from sqrt(::Float64)\\n\");\n}In order to check whether ret is of a specific Julia type, we can use the jl_isa, jl_typeis, or jl_is_... functions. By typing typeof(sqrt(2.0)) into the Julia shell we can see that the return type is Float64 (double in C). To convert the boxed Julia value into a C double the jl_unbox_float64 function is used in the above code snippet.Corresponding jl_box_... functions are used to convert the other way:jl_value_t *a = jl_box_float64(3.0);\njl_value_t *b = jl_box_float32(3.0f);\njl_value_t *c = jl_box_int32(3);As we will see next, boxing is required to call Julia functions with specific arguments."

    "text": "As we have seen, Julia objects are represented in C as pointers. This raises the question of who is responsible for freeing these objects.Typically, Julia objects are freed by a garbage collector (GC), but the GC does not automatically know that we are holding a reference to a Julia value from C. This means the GC can free objects out from under you, rendering pointers invalid.The GC can only run when Julia objects are allocated. Calls like jl_box_float64 perform allocation, and allocation might also happen at any point in running Julia code. However, it is generally safe to use pointers in between jl_... calls. But in order to make sure that values can survive jl_... calls, we have to tell Julia that we hold a reference to a Julia value. This can be done using the JL_GC_PUSH macros:jl_value_t *ret = jl_eval_string(\"sqrt(2.0)\");\nJL_GC_PUSH1(&ret);\n// Do something with ret\nJL_GC_POP();The JL_GC_POP call releases the references established by the previous JL_GC_PUSH. Note that JL_GC_PUSH  is working on the stack, so it must be exactly paired with a JL_GC_POP before the stack frame is destroyed.Several Julia values can be pushed at once using the JL_GC_PUSH2 , JL_GC_PUSH3 , and JL_GC_PUSH4 macros. To push an array of Julia values one can use the  JL_GC_PUSHARGS macro, which can be used as follows:jl_value_t **args;\nJL_GC_PUSHARGS(args, 2); // args can now hold 2 `jl_value_t*` objects\nargs[0] = some_value;\nargs[1] = some_other_value;\n// Do something with args (e.g. call jl_... functions)\nJL_GC_POP();The garbage collector also operates under the assumption that it is aware of every old-generation object pointing to a young-generation one. Any time a pointer is updated breaking that assumption, it must be signaled to the collector with the jl_gc_wb (write barrier) function like so:jl_value_t *parent = some_old_value, *child = some_young_value;\n((some_specific_type*)parent)->field = child;\njl_gc_wb(parent, child);It is in general impossible to predict which values will be old at runtime, so the write barrier must be inserted after all explicit stores. One notable exception is if the parent object was just allocated and garbage collection was not run since then. Remember that most jl_... functions can sometimes invoke garbage collection.The write barrier is also necessary for arrays of pointers when updating their data directly. For example:jl_array_t *some_array = ...; // e.g. a Vector{Any}\nvoid **data = (void**)jl_array_data(some_array);\njl_value_t *some_value = ...;\ndata[0] = some_value;\njl_gc_wb(some_array, some_value);"

All package manager commands are found in the Pkg module, included in Julia's Base install.First we'll go over the mechanics of the Pkg family of commands and then we'll provide some guidance on how to get your package registered.

    "text": "Julia's package manager is a little unusual in that it is declarative rather than imperative. This means that you tell it what you want and it figures out what versions to install (or remove) to satisfy those requirements optimally – and minimally. So rather than installing a package, you just add it to the list of requirements and then \"resolve\" what needs to be installed. In particular, this means that if some package had been installed because it was needed by a previous version of something you wanted, and a newer version doesn't have that requirement anymore, updating will actually remove that package.Your package requirements are in the file ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE. You can edit this file by hand and then call Pkg.resolve() to install, upgrade or remove packages to optimally satisfy the requirements, or you can do Pkg.edit(), which will open REQUIRE in your editor (configured via the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variables), and then automatically call Pkg.resolve() afterwards if necessary. If you only want to add or remove the requirement for a single package, you can also use the non-interactive Pkg.add() and Pkg.rm() commands, which add or remove a single requirement to REQUIRE and then call Pkg.resolve().You can add a package to the list of requirements with the Pkg.add() function, and the package and all the packages that it depends on will be installed:julia> Pkg.status()\nNo packages installed.\n\njulia> Pkg.add(\"Distributions\")\nINFO: Cloning cache of Distributions from git://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl.git\nINFO: Cloning cache of NumericExtensions from git://github.com/lindahua/NumericExtensions.jl.git\nINFO: Cloning cache of Stats from git://github.com/JuliaStats/Stats.jl.git\nINFO: Installing Distributions v0.2.7\nINFO: Installing NumericExtensions v0.2.17\nINFO: Installing Stats v0.2.6\nINFO: REQUIRE updated.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.7\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.6What this is doing is first adding Distributions to your ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE file:$ cat ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE\nDistributionsIt then runs Pkg.resolve() using these new requirements, which leads to the conclusion that the Distributions package should be installed since it is required but not installed. As stated before, you can accomplish the same thing by editing your ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE file by hand and then running Pkg.resolve() yourself:$ echo SHA >> ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE\n\njulia> Pkg.resolve()\nINFO: Cloning cache of SHA from git://github.com/staticfloat/SHA.jl.git\nINFO: Installing SHA v0.3.2\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.7\n - SHA                           0.3.2\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.6This is functionally equivalent to calling Pkg.add(\"SHA\"), except that Pkg.add() doesn't change REQUIRE until after installation has completed, so if there are problems, REQUIRE will be left as it was before calling Pkg.add(). The format of the REQUIRE file is described in Requirements Specification; it allows, among other things, requiring specific ranges of versions of packages.When you decide that you don't want to have a package around any more, you can use Pkg.rm() to remove the requirement for it from the REQUIRE file:julia> Pkg.rm(\"Distributions\")\nINFO: Removing Distributions v0.2.7\nINFO: Removing Stats v0.2.6\nINFO: Removing NumericExtensions v0.2.17\nINFO: REQUIRE updated.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - SHA                           0.3.2\n\njulia> Pkg.rm(\"SHA\")\nINFO: Removing SHA v0.3.2\nINFO: REQUIRE updated.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nNo packages installed.Once again, this is equivalent to editing the REQUIRE file to remove the line with each package name on it then running Pkg.resolve() to update the set of installed packages to match. While Pkg.add() and Pkg.rm() are convenient for adding and removing requirements for a single package, when you want to add or remove multiple packages, you can call Pkg.edit() to manually change the contents of REQUIRE and then update your packages accordingly. Pkg.edit() does not roll back the contents of REQUIRE if Pkg.resolve() fails – rather, you have to run Pkg.edit() again to fix the files contents yourself.Because the package manager uses libgit2 internally to manage the package git repositories, users may run into protocol issues (if behind a firewall, for example), when running Pkg.add(). By default, all GitHub-hosted packages wil be accessed via 'https'; this default can be modified by calling Pkg.setprotocol!(). The following command can be run from the command line in order to tell git to use 'https' instead of the 'git' protocol when cloning all repositories, wherever they are hosted:git config --global url.\"https://\".insteadOf git://However, this change will be system-wide and thus the use of Pkg.setprotocol!() is preferable.note: Note\nThe package manager functions also accept the .jl suffix on package names, though the suffix is stripped internally. For example:Pkg.add(\"Distributions.jl\")\nPkg.rm(\"Distributions.jl\")"

    "text": "Julia packages are simply git repositories, clonable via any of the protocols that git supports, and containing Julia code that follows certain layout conventions. Official Julia packages are registered in the METADATA.jl repository, available at a well-known location [1]. The Pkg.add() and Pkg.rm() commands in the previous section interact with registered packages, but the package manager can install and work with unregistered packages too. To install an unregistered package, use Pkg.clone(url), where url is a git URL from which the package can be cloned:julia> Pkg.clone(\"git://example.com/path/to/Package.jl.git\")\nINFO: Cloning Package from git://example.com/path/to/Package.jl.git\nCloning into 'Package'...\nremote: Counting objects: 22, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.\nremote: Total 22 (delta 8), reused 22 (delta 8)\nReceiving objects: 100% (22/22), 2.64 KiB, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (8/8), done.By convention, Julia repository names end with .jl (the additional .git indicates a \"bare\" git repository), which keeps them from colliding with repositories for other languages, and also makes Julia packages easy to find in search engines. When packages are installed in your .julia/v0.6 directory, however, the extension is redundant so we leave it off.If unregistered packages contain a REQUIRE file at the top of their source tree, that file will be used to determine which registered packages the unregistered package depends on, and they will automatically be installed. Unregistered packages participate in the same version resolution logic as registered packages, so installed package versions will be adjusted as necessary to satisfy the requirements of both registered and unregistered packages.[1]: The official set of packages is at https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl, but individuals and organizations can easily use a different metadata repository. This allows control which packages are available for automatic installation. One can allow only audited and approved package versions, and make private packages or forks available.

    "text": "When package developers publish new registered versions of packages that you're using, you will, of course, want the new shiny versions. To get the latest and greatest versions of all your packages, just do Pkg.update():julia> Pkg.update()\nINFO: Updating METADATA...\nINFO: Computing changes...\nINFO: Upgrading Distributions: v0.2.8 => v0.2.10\nINFO: Upgrading Stats: v0.2.7 => v0.2.8The first step of updating packages is to pull new changes to ~/.julia/v0.6/METADATA and see if any new registered package versions have been published. After this, Pkg.update() attempts to update packages that are checked out on a branch and not dirty (i.e. no changes have been made to files tracked by git) by pulling changes from the package's upstream repository. Upstream changes will only be applied if no merging or rebasing is necessary – i.e. if the branch can be \"fast-forwarded\". If the branch cannot be fast-forwarded, it is assumed that you're working on it and will update the repository yourself.Finally, the update process recomputes an optimal set of package versions to have installed to satisfy your top-level requirements and the requirements of \"fixed\" packages. A package is considered fixed if it is one of the following:Unregistered: the package is not in METADATA – you installed it with Pkg.clone().\nChecked out: the package repo is on a development branch.\nDirty: changes have been made to files in the repo.If any of these are the case, the package manager cannot freely change the installed version of the package, so its requirements must be satisfied by whatever other package versions it picks. The combination of top-level requirements in ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE and the requirement of fixed packages are used to determine what should be installed.You can also update only a subset of the installed packages, by providing arguments to the Pkg.update function. In that case, only the packages provided as arguments and their dependencies will be updated:julia> Pkg.update(\"Example\")\nINFO: Updating METADATA...\nINFO: Computing changes...\nINFO: Upgrading Example: v0.4.0 => 0.4.1This partial update process still computes the new set of package versions according to top-level requirements and \"fixed\" packages, but it additionally considers all other packages except those explicitly provided, and their dependencies, as fixed."

There might be fixes or functionality on master that you need that aren't yet published in any registered versions, or you may be a developer of the package and need to make changes on master or some other development branch. In such cases, you can do Pkg.checkout(pkg) to checkout the master branch of pkg or Pkg.checkout(pkg,branch) to checkout some other branch:julia> Pkg.add(\"Distributions\")\nINFO: Installing Distributions v0.2.9\nINFO: Installing NumericExtensions v0.2.17\nINFO: Installing Stats v0.2.7\nINFO: REQUIRE updated.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.9\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.7\n\njulia> Pkg.checkout(\"Distributions\")\nINFO: Checking out Distributions master...\nINFO: No packages to install, update or remove.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.9+             master\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.7Immediately after installing Distributions with Pkg.add() it is on the current most recent registered version – 0.2.9 at the time of writing this. Then after running Pkg.checkout(\"Distributions\"), you can see from the output of Pkg.status() that Distributions is on an unregistered version greater than 0.2.9, indicated by the \"pseudo-version\" number 0.2.9+.When you checkout an unregistered version of a package, the copy of the REQUIRE file in the package repo takes precedence over any requirements registered in METADATA, so it is important that developers keep this file accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the actual requirements of the current version of the package. If the REQUIRE file in the package repo is incorrect or missing, dependencies may be removed when the package is checked out. This file is also used to populate newly published versions of the package if you use the API that Pkg provides for this (described below).When you decide that you no longer want to have a package checked out on a branch, you can \"free\" it back to the control of the package manager with Pkg.free(pkg):julia> Pkg.free(\"Distributions\")\nINFO: Freeing Distributions...\nINFO: No packages to install, update or remove.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.9\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.7After this, since the package is on a registered version and not on a branch, its version will be updated as new registered versions of the package are published.If you want to pin a package at a specific version so that calling Pkg.update() won't change the version the package is on, you can use the Pkg.pin() function:julia> Pkg.pin(\"Stats\")\nINFO: Creating Stats branch pinned.47c198b1.tmp\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.9\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.7              pinned.47c198b1.tmpAfter this, the Stats package will remain pinned at version 0.2.7 – or more specifically, at commit 47c198b1, but since versions are permanently associated a given git hash, this is the same thing. Pkg.pin() works by creating a throw-away branch for the commit you want to pin the package at and then checking that branch out. By default, it pins a package at the current commit, but you can choose a different version by passing a second argument:julia> Pkg.pin(\"Stats\",v\"0.2.5\")\nINFO: Creating Stats branch pinned.1fd0983b.tmp\nINFO: No packages to install, update or remove.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.9\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.5              pinned.1fd0983b.tmpNow the Stats package is pinned at commit 1fd0983b, which corresponds to version 0.2.5. When you decide to \"unpin\" a package and let the package manager update it again, you can use Pkg.free() like you would to move off of any branch:julia> Pkg.free(\"Stats\")\nINFO: Freeing Stats...\nINFO: No packages to install, update or remove.\n\njulia> Pkg.status()\nRequired packages:\n - Distributions                 0.2.9\nAdditional packages:\n - NumericExtensions             0.2.17\n - Stats                         0.2.7After this, the Stats package is managed by the package manager again, and future calls to Pkg.update() will upgrade it to newer versions when they are published. The throw-away pinned.1fd0983b.tmp branch remains in your local Stats repo, but since git branches are extremely lightweight, this doesn't really matter; if you feel like cleaning them up, you can go into the repo and delete those branches [2].[2]: Packages that aren't on branches will also be marked as dirty if you make changes in the repo, but that's a less common thing to do."

You can initialize your local metadata repository using that custom location and branch and then periodically rebase your custom branch with the official metadata-v2 branch.

    "text": "If you want to fix a bug or add new functionality, you want to be able to test your changes before you submit them for consideration. You also need to have an easy way to update your proposal in response to the package owner's feedback. Consequently, in this case the strategy is to work locally on your own machine; once you are satisfied with your changes, you submit them for consideration.  This process is called a pull request because you are asking to \"pull\" your changes into the project's main repository. Because the online repository can't see the code on your private machine, you first push your changes to a publicly-visible location, your own online fork of the package (hosted on your own personal GitHub account).Let's assume you already have the Foo package installed. In the description below, anything starting with Pkg. or PkgDev. is meant to be typed at the Julia prompt; anything starting with git is meant to be typed in julia's shell mode (or using the shell that comes with your operating system). Within Julia, you can combine these two modes:julia> cd(Pkg.dir(\"Foo\"))          # go to Foo's folder\n\nshell> git command arguments...    # command will apply to FooNow suppose you're ready to make some changes to Foo. While there are several possible approaches, here is one that is widely used:From the Julia prompt, type Pkg.checkout(\"Foo\"). This ensures you're running the latest code (the master branch), rather than just whatever \"official release\" version you have installed. (If you're planning to fix a bug, at this point it's a good idea to check again whether the bug has already been fixed by someone else. If it has, you can request that a new official release be tagged so that the fix gets distributed to the rest of the community.) If you receive an error Foo is dirty, bailing, see Dirty packages below.\nCreate a branch for your changes: navigate to the package folder (the one that Julia reports from Pkg.dir(\"Foo\")) and (in shell mode) create a new branch using git checkout -b <newbranch>, where <newbranch> might be some descriptive name (e.g., fixbar). By creating a branch, you ensure that you can easily go back and forth between your new work and the current master branch (see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell).\nIf you forget to do this step until after you've already made some changes, don't worry: see more detail about branching below.\nMake your changes. Whether it's fixing a bug or adding new functionality, in most cases your change should include updates to both the src/ and test/ folders. If you're fixing a bug, add your minimal example demonstrating the bug (on the current code) to the test suite; by contributing a test for the bug, you ensure that the bug won't accidentally reappear at some later time due to other changes. If you're adding new functionality, creating tests demonstrates to the package owner that you've made sure your code works as intended.\nRun the package's tests and make sure they pass. There are several ways to run the tests:\nFrom Julia, run Pkg.test(\"Foo\"): this will run your tests in a separate (new) julia process.\nFrom Julia, include(\"runtests.jl\") from the package's test/ folder (it's possible the file has a different name, look for one that runs all the tests): this allows you to run the tests repeatedly in the same session without reloading all the package code; for packages that take a while to load, this can be much faster. With this approach, you do have to do some extra work to make changes in the package code.\nFrom the shell, run julia ../test/runtests.jl from within the package's src/ folder.\nCommit your changes: see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository.\nSubmit your changes: From the Julia prompt, type PkgDev.submit(\"Foo\"). This will push your changes to your GitHub fork, creating it if it doesn't already exist. (If you encounter an error, make sure you've set up your SSH keys.) Julia will then give you a hyperlink; open that link, edit the message, and then click \"submit.\" At that point, the package owner will be notified of your changes and may initiate discussion. (If you are comfortable with git, you can also do these steps manually from the shell.)\nThe package owner may suggest additional improvements. To respond to those suggestions, you can easily update the pull request (this only works for changes that have not already been merged; for merged pull requests, make new changes by starting a new branch):\nIf you've changed branches in the meantime, make sure you go back to the same branch with git checkout fixbar (from shell mode) or Pkg.checkout(\"Foo\", \"fixbar\") (from the Julia prompt).\nAs above, make your changes, run the tests, and commit your changes.\nFrom the shell, type git push.  This will add your new commit(s) to the same pull request; you should see them appear automatically on the page holding the discussion of your pull request.\nOne potential type of change the owner may request is that you squash your commits.

Your changes have not yet been committed to this new branch, so the normal work rules still apply.However, if you've already made a commit to master but wish to go back to the official master (called origin/master), use the following procedure:Create a new branch. This branch will hold your changes.\nMake sure everything is committed to this branch.\ngit checkout master. If this fails, do not proceed further until you have resolved the problems, or you may lose your changes.\nResetmaster (your current branch) back to an earlier state with git reset --hard origin/master (see https://git-scm.com/blog/2011/07/11/reset.html).This requires a bit more familiarity with git, so it's much better to get in the habit of creating a branch at the outset."

Putting a floor on what Julia version your package supports is done by simply adding julia 0.x in this file. While this line is partly informational, it also has the consequence of whether Pkg.update() will update code found in .julia version directories. It will not update code found in version directories beneath the floor of what's specified in your REQUIRE.As the development version 0.y matures, you may find yourself using it more frequently, and wanting your package to support it. Be warned, the development branch of Julia is the land of breakage, and you can expect things to break. When you go about fixing whatever broke your package in the development 0.y branch, you will likely find that you just broke your package on the stable version.There is a mechanism found in the Compat package that will enable you to support both the stable version and breaking changes found in the development version. Should you decide to use this solution, you will need to add Compat to your REQUIRE file. In this case, you will still have julia 0.x in your REQUIRE. The x is the floor version of what your package supports.You might also have no interest in supporting the development version of Julia. Just as you can add a floor to the version you expect your users to be on, you can set an upper bound. In this case, you would put julia 0.x 0.y- in your REQUIRE file. The - at the end of the version number means pre-release versions of that specific version from the very first commit. By setting it as the ceiling, you mean the code supports everything up to but not including the ceiling version.Another scenario is that you are writing the bulk of the code for your package with Julia 0.y and do not want to support the current stable version of Julia. If you choose to do this, simply add julia 0.y- to your REQUIRE. Just remember to change the julia 0.y- to julia 0.y in your REQUIRE file once 0.y is officially released. If you don't edit the dash cruft you are suggesting that you support both the development and stable versions of the same version number! That would be madness. See the Requirements Specification for the full format of REQUIRE.Lastly, in many cases you may need extra packages for testing. Additional packages which are only required for tests should be specified in the test/REQUIRE file. This REQUIRE file has the same specification as the standard REQUIRE file."

    "text": "Package names should be sensible to most Julia users, even to those who are not domain experts. When you submit your package to METADATA, you can expect a little back and forth about the package name with collaborators, especially if it's ambiguous or can be confused with something other than what it is. During this bike-shedding, it's not uncommon to get a range of different name suggestions. These are only suggestions though, with the intent being to keep a tidy namespace in the curated METADATA repository. Since this repository belongs to the entire community, there will likely be a few collaborators who care about your package name. Here are some guidelines to follow in naming your package:Avoid jargon. In particular, avoid acronyms unless there is minimal possibility of confusion.\nIt's ok to say USA if you're talking about the USA.\nIt's not ok to say PMA, even if you're talking about positive mental attitude.\nAvoid using Julia in your package name.\nIt is usually clear from context and to your users that the package is a Julia package.\nHaving Julia in the name can imply that the package is connected to, or endorsed by, contributors to the Julia language itself.\nPackages that provide most of their functionality in association with a new type should have pluralized names.\nDataFrames provides the DataFrame type.\nBloomFilters provides the BloomFilter type.\nIn contrast, JuliaParser provides no new type, but instead new functionality in the JuliaParser.parse() function.\nErr on the side of clarity, even if clarity seems long-winded to you.\nRandomMatrices is a less ambiguous name than RndMat or RMT, even though the latter are shorter.\nA less systematic name may suit a package that implements one of several possible approaches to its domain.\nJulia does not have a single comprehensive plotting package. Instead, Gadfly, PyPlot, Winston and other packages each implement a unique approach based on a particular design philosophy.\nIn contrast, SortingAlgorithms provides a consistent interface to use many well-established sorting algorithms.\nPackages that wrap external libraries or programs should be named after those libraries or programs.\nCPLEX.jl wraps the CPLEX library, which can be identified easily in a web search.\nMATLAB.jl provides an interface to call the MATLAB engine from within Julia."

    "text": "The ~/.julia/v0.6/REQUIRE file, the REQUIRE file inside packages, and the METADATA package requires files use a simple line-based format to express the ranges of package versions which need to be installed. Package REQUIRE and METADATA requires files should also include the range of versions of julia the package is expected to work with. Additionally, packages can include a test/REQUIRE file to specify additional packages which are only required for testing.Here's how these files are parsed and interpreted.Everything after a # mark is stripped from each line as a comment.\nIf nothing but whitespace is left, the line is ignored.\nIf there are non-whitespace characters remaining, the line is a requirement and the is split on whitespace into words.The simplest possible requirement is just the name of a package name on a line by itself:DistributionsThis requirement is satisfied by any version of the Distributions package. The package name can be followed by zero or more version numbers in ascending order, indicating acceptable intervals of versions of that package. One version opens an interval, while the next closes it, and the next opens a new interval, and so on; if an odd number of version numbers are given, then arbitrarily large versions will satisfy; if an even number of version numbers are given, the last one is an upper limit on acceptable version numbers. For example, the line:Distributions 0.1is satisfied by any version of Distributions greater than or equal to 0.1.0. Suffixing a version with - allows any pre-release versions as well. For example:Distributions 0.1-is satisfied by pre-release versions such as 0.1-dev or 0.1-rc1, or by any version greater than or equal to 0.1.0.This requirement entry:Distributions 0.1 0.2.5is satisfied by versions from 0.1.0 up to, but not including 0.2.5. If you want to indicate that any 0.1.x version will do, you will want to write:Distributions 0.1 0.2-If you want to start accepting versions after 0.2.7, you can write:Distributions 0.1 0.2- 0.2.7If a requirement line has leading words that begin with @, it is a system-dependent requirement. If your system matches these system conditionals, the requirement is included, if not, the requirement is ignored. For example:@osx Homebrewwill require the Homebrew package only on systems where the operating system is OS X. The system conditions that are currently supported are (hierarchically):@unix\n@linux\n@bsd\n@osx\n@windowsThe @unix condition is satisfied on all UNIX systems, including Linux and BSD. Negated system conditionals are also supported by adding a ! after the leading @. Examples:@!windows\n@unix @!osxThe first condition applies to any system but Windows and the second condition applies to any UNIX system besides OS X.Runtime checks for the current version of Julia can be made using the built-in VERSION variable, which is of type VersionNumber. Such code is occasionally necessary to keep track of new or deprecated functionality between various releases of Julia. Examples of runtime checks:VERSION < v\"0.3-\" #exclude all pre-release versions of 0.3\n\nv\"0.2-\" <= VERSION < v\"0.3-\" #get all 0.2 versions, including pre-releases, up to the above\n\nv\"0.2\" <= VERSION < v\"0.3-\" #To get only stable 0.2 versions (Note v\"0.2\" == v\"0.2.0\")\n\nVERSION >= v\"0.2.1\" #get at least version 0.2.1See the section on version number literals for a more complete description."

When used, it takes measurements on running code, and produces output that helps you understand how much time is spent on individual line(s). The most common usage is to identify \"bottlenecks\" as targets for optimization.Profile implements what is known as a \"sampling\" or statistical profiler.  It works by periodically taking a backtrace during the execution of any task. Each backtrace captures the currently-running function and line number, plus the complete chain of function calls that led to this line, and hence is a \"snapshot\" of the current state of execution.If much of your run time is spent executing a particular line of code, this line will show up frequently in the set of all backtraces. In other words, the \"cost\" of a given line–or really, the cost of the sequence of function calls up to and including this line–is proportional to how often it appears in the set of all backtraces.A sampling profiler does not provide complete line-by-line coverage, because the backtraces occur at intervals (by default, 1 ms on Unix systems and 10 ms on Windows, although the actual scheduling is subject to operating system load). Moreover, as discussed further below, because samples are collected at a sparse subset of all execution points, the data collected by a sampling profiler is subject to statistical noise.Despite these limitations, sampling profilers have substantial strengths:You do not have to make any modifications to your code to take timing measurements (in contrast to the alternative instrumenting profiler).\nIt can profile into Julia's core code and even (optionally) into C and Fortran libraries.\nBy running \"infrequently\" there is very little performance overhead; while profiling, your code can run at nearly native speed.For these reasons, it's recommended that you try using the built-in sampling profiler before considering any alternatives."

The second field is the file name and line number and the third field is the function name. Note that the specific line numbers may change as Julia's code changes; if you want to follow along, it's best to run this example yourself.In this example, we can see that the top level function called is in the file event.jl. This is the function that runs the REPL when you launch Julia. If you examine line 97 of REPL.jl, you'll see this is where the function eval_user_input() is called. This is the function that evaluates what you type at the REPL, and since we're working interactively these functions were invoked when we entered @profile myfunc(). The next line reflects actions taken in the @profile macro.The first line shows that 80 backtraces were taken at line 73 of event.jl, but it's not that this line was \"expensive\" on its own: the third line reveals that all 80 of these backtraces were actually triggered inside its call to eval_user_input, and so on. To find out which operations are actually taking the time, we need to look deeper in the call chain.The first \"important\" line in this output is this one:52 ./REPL[1]:2; myfunc()REPL refers to the fact that we defined myfunc in the REPL, rather than putting it in a file; if we had used a file, this would show the file name. The [1] shows that the function myfunc was the first expression evaluated in this REPL session. Line 2 of myfunc() contains the call to rand, and there were 52 (out of 80) backtraces that occurred at this line. Below that, you can see a call to dsfmt_fill_array_close_open! inside dSFMT.jl.A little further down, you see:28 ./REPL[1]:3; myfunc()Line 3 of myfunc contains the call to maximum, and there were 28 (out of 80) backtraces taken here. Below that, you can see the specific places in base/reduce.jl that carry out the time-consuming operations in the maximum function for this type of input data.Overall, we can tentatively conclude that generating the random numbers is approximately twice as expensive as finding the maximum element. We could increase our confidence in this result by collecting more samples:julia> @profile (for i = 1:100; myfunc(); end)\n\njulia> Profile.print()\n[....]\n 3821 ./REPL[1]:2; myfunc()\n  3511 ./random.jl:431; rand!(::MersenneTwister, ::Array{Float64,3}, ::Int64, ::Type...\n   3511 ./dSFMT.jl:84; dsfmt_fill_array_close_open!(::Base.dSFMT.DSFMT_state, ::Ptr...\n  310  ./random.jl:278; rand\n   [....]\n 2893 ./REPL[1]:3; myfunc()\n  2893 ./reduce.jl:270; _mapreduce(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarmax, ::IndexLinea...\n   [....]In general, if you have N samples collected at a line, you can expect an uncertainty on the order of sqrt(N) (barring other sources of noise, like how busy the computer is with other tasks). The major exception to this rule is garbage collection, which runs infrequently but tends to be quite expensive. (Since Julia's garbage collector is written in C, such events can be detected using the C=true output mode described below, or by using ProfileView.jl.)This illustrates the default \"tree\" dump; an alternative is the \"flat\" dump, which accumulates counts independent of their nesting:julia> Profile.print(format=:flat)\n Count File          Line Function\n  6714 ./<missing>     -1 anonymous\n  6714 ./REPL.jl       66 eval_user_input(::Any, ::Base.REPL.REPLBackend)\n  6714 ./REPL.jl       97 macro expansion\n  3821 ./REPL[1]        2 myfunc()\n  2893 ./REPL[1]        3 myfunc()\n  6714 ./REPL[7]        1 macro expansion\n  6714 ./boot.jl      235 eval(::Module, ::Any)\n  3511 ./dSFMT.jl      84 dsfmt_fill_array_close_open!(::Base.dSFMT.DSFMT_s...\n  6714 ./event.jl      73 (::Base.REPL.##1#2{Base.REPL.REPLBackend})()\n  6714 ./profile.jl    23 macro expansion\n  3511 ./random.jl    431 rand!(::MersenneTwister, ::Array{Float64,3}, ::In...\n   310 ./random.jl    277 rand\n   310 ./random.jl    278 rand\n   310 ./random.jl    366 rand\n   310 ./random.jl    369 rand\n  2893 ./reduce.jl    270 _mapreduce(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarmax, :...\n     5 ./reduce.jl    420 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...\n   253 ./reduce.jl    426 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...\n  2592 ./reduce.jl    428 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...\n    43 ./reduce.jl    429 mapreduce_impl(::Base.#identity, ::Base.#scalarma...If your code has recursion, one potentially-confusing point is that a line in a \"child\" function can accumulate more counts than there are total backtraces. Consider the following function definitions:dumbsum(n::Integer) = n == 1 ? 1 : 1 + dumbsum(n-1)\ndumbsum3() = dumbsum(3)If you were to profile dumbsum3, and a backtrace was taken while it was executing dumbsum(1), the backtrace would look like this:dumbsum3\n    dumbsum(3)\n        dumbsum(2)\n            dumbsum(1)Consequently, this child function gets 3 counts, even though the parent only gets one. The \"tree\" representation makes this much clearer, and for this reason (among others) is probably the most useful way to view the results."

Let's see the full declaration:function print(io::IO = STDOUT, data = fetch(); kwargs...)Let's first discuss the two positional arguments, and later the keyword arguments:io – Allows you to save the results to a buffer, e.g. a file, but the default is to print to STDOUT (the console).\ndata – Contains the data you want to analyze; by default that is obtained from Profile.fetch(), which pulls out the backtraces from a pre-allocated buffer. For example, if you want to profile the profiler, you could say:\ndata = copy(Profile.fetch())\nProfile.clear()\n@profile Profile.print(STDOUT, data) # Prints the previous results\nProfile.print()                      # Prints results from Profile.print()The keyword arguments can be any combination of:format – Introduced above, determines whether backtraces are printed  with (default, :tree) or without (:flat) indentation indicating tree  structure.\nC – If true, backtraces from C and Fortran code are shown (normally they are excluded). Try running the introductory example with Profile.print(C = true). This can be extremely helpful in deciding whether it's Julia code or C code that is causing a bottleneck; setting C = true also improves the interpretability of the nesting, at the cost of longer profile dumps.\ncombine – Some lines of code contain multiple operations; for example, s += A[i] contains both an array reference (A[i]) and a sum operation. These correspond to different lines in the generated machine code, and hence there may be two or more different addresses captured during backtraces on this line. combine = true lumps them together, and is probably what you typically want, but you can generate an output separately for each unique instruction pointer with combine = false.\nmaxdepth – Limits frames at a depth higher than maxdepth in the :tree format.\nsortedby – Controls the order in :flat format. :filefuncline (default) sorts by the source line, whereas :count sorts in order of number of collected samples.\nnoisefloor – Limits frames that are below the heuristic noise floor of the sample (only applies to format :tree). A suggested value to try for this is 2.0 (the default is 0). This parameter hides samples for which n <= noisefloor * √N, where n is the number of samples on this line, and N is the number of samples for the callee.\nmincount – Limits frames with less than mincount occurrences.File/function names are sometimes truncated (with ...), and indentation is truncated with a +n at the beginning, where n is the number of extra spaces that would have been inserted, had there been room. If you want a complete profile of deeply-nested code, often a good idea is to save to a file using a wide displaysize in an IOContext:open(\"/tmp/prof.txt\", \"w\") do s\n    Profile.print(IOContext(s, :displaysize => (24, 500)))\nend"

    "text": "@profile just accumulates backtraces, and the analysis happens when you call Profile.print(). For a long-running computation, it's entirely possible that the pre-allocated buffer for storing backtraces will be filled. If that happens, the backtraces stop but your computation continues. As a consequence, you may miss some important profiling data (you will get a warning when that happens).You can obtain and configure the relevant parameters this way:Profile.init() # returns the current settings\nProfile.init(n = 10^7, delay = 0.01)n is the total number of instruction pointers you can store, with a default value of 10^6. If your typical backtrace is 20 instruction pointers, then you can collect 50000 backtraces, which suggests a statistical uncertainty of less than 1%. This may be good enough for most applications.Consequently, you are more likely to need to modify delay, expressed in seconds, which sets the amount of time that Julia gets between snapshots to perform the requested computations. A very long-running job might not need frequent backtraces. The default setting is delay = 0.001. Of course, you can decrease the delay as well as increase it; however, the overhead of profiling grows once the delay becomes similar to the amount of time needed to take a backtrace (~30 microseconds on the author's laptop)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "One of the most common techniques to improve performance is to reduce memory allocation. The total amount of allocation can be measured with @time and @allocated, and specific lines triggering allocation can often be inferred from profiling via the cost of garbage collection that these lines incur. However, sometimes it is more efficient to directly measure the amount of memory allocated by each line of code.To measure allocation line-by-line, start Julia with the --track-allocation=<setting> command-line option, for which you can choose none (the default, do not measure allocation), user (measure memory allocation everywhere except Julia's core code), or all (measure memory allocation at each line of Julia code). Allocation gets measured for each line of compiled code. When you quit Julia, the cumulative results are written to text files with .mem appended after the file name, residing in the same directory as the source file. Each line lists the total number of bytes allocated. The Coverage package contains some elementary analysis tools, for example to sort the lines in order of number of bytes allocated.In interpreting the results, there are a few important details. Under the user setting, the first line of any function directly called from the REPL will exhibit allocation due to events that happen in the REPL code itself. More significantly, JIT-compilation also adds to allocation counts, because much of Julia's compiler is written in Julia (and compilation usually requires memory allocation). The recommended procedure is to force compilation by executing all the commands you want to analyze, then call Profile.clear_malloc_data() to reset all allocation counters.  Finally, execute the desired commands and quit Julia to trigger the generation of the .mem files."

(If you've not yet used @time in this session, it will also compile functions needed for timing.)  You should not take the results of this run seriously. For the second run, note that in addition to reporting the time, it also indicated that a large amount of memory was allocated. This is the single biggest advantage of @time vs. functions like tic() and toc(), which only report time.Unexpected memory allocation is almost always a sign of some problem with your code, usually a problem with type-stability. Consequently, in addition to the allocation itself, it's very likely that the code generated for your function is far from optimal. Take such indications seriously and follow the advice below.For more serious benchmarking, consider the BenchmarkTools.jl package which evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.As a teaser, an improved version of this function allocates no memory (the allocation reported below is due to running the @time macro in global scope) and has an order of magnitude faster execution after the first call:julia> @time f_improved(1)\n  0.007008 seconds (1.32 k allocations: 63.640 KiB)\n0.5\n\njulia> @time f_improved(10^6)\n  0.002997 seconds (6 allocations: 192 bytes)\n2.5000025e11Below you'll learn how to spot the problem with f and how to fix it.In some situations, your function may need to allocate memory as part of its operation, and this can complicate the simple picture above. In such cases, consider using one of the tools below to diagnose problems, or write a version of your function that separates allocation from its algorithmic aspects (see Pre-allocating outputs)."

    "text": "Types can be declared without specifying the types of their fields:julia> struct MyAmbiguousType\n           a\n       endThis allows a to be of any type. This can often be useful, but it does have a downside: for objects of type MyAmbiguousType, the compiler will not be able to generate high-performance code.  The reason is that the compiler uses the types of objects, not their values, to determine how to build code. Unfortunately, very little can be inferred about an object of type MyAmbiguousType:julia> b = MyAmbiguousType(\"Hello\")\nMyAmbiguousType(\"Hello\")\n\njulia> c = MyAmbiguousType(17)\nMyAmbiguousType(17)\n\njulia> typeof(b)\nMyAmbiguousType\n\njulia> typeof(c)\nMyAmbiguousTypeb and c have the same type, yet their underlying representation of data in memory is very different. Even if you stored just numeric values in field a, the fact that the memory representation of a UInt8 differs from a Float64 also means that the CPU needs to handle them using two different kinds of instructions. Since the required information is not available in the type, such decisions have to be made at run-time. This slows performance.You can do better by declaring the type of a. Here, we are focused on the case where a might be any one of several types, in which case the natural solution is to use parameters. For example:julia> mutable struct MyType{T<:AbstractFloat}\n           a::T\n       endThis is a better choice thanjulia> mutable struct MyStillAmbiguousType\n           a::AbstractFloat\n       endbecause the first version specifies the type of a from the type of the wrapper object.  For example:julia> m = MyType(3.2)\nMyType{Float64}(3.2)\n\njulia> t = MyStillAmbiguousType(3.2)\nMyStillAmbiguousType(3.2)\n\njulia> typeof(m)\nMyType{Float64}\n\njulia> typeof(t)\nMyStillAmbiguousTypeThe type of field a can be readily determined from the type of m, but not from the type of t.  Indeed, in t it's possible to change the type of field a:julia> typeof(t.a)\nFloat64\n\njulia> t.a = 4.5f0\n4.5f0\n\njulia> typeof(t.a)\nFloat32In contrast, once m is constructed, the type of m.a cannot change:julia> m.a = 4.5f0\n4.5f0\n\njulia> typeof(m.a)\nFloat64The fact that the type of m.a is known from m's type–coupled with the fact that its type cannot change mid-function–allows the compiler to generate highly-optimized code for objects like m but not for objects like t.Of course, all of this is true only if we construct m with a concrete type.  We can break this by explicitly constructing it with an abstract type:julia> m = MyType{AbstractFloat}(3.2)\nMyType{AbstractFloat}(3.2)\n\njulia> typeof(m.a)\nFloat64\n\njulia> m.a = 4.5f0\n4.5f0\n\njulia> typeof(m.a)\nFloat32For all practical purposes, such objects behave identically to those of MyStillAmbiguousType.It's quite instructive to compare the sheer amount code generated for a simple functionfunc(m::MyType) = m.a+1usingcode_llvm(func,Tuple{MyType{Float64}})\ncode_llvm(func,Tuple{MyType{AbstractFloat}})\ncode_llvm(func,Tuple{MyType})For reasons of length the results are not shown here, but you may wish to try this yourself. Because the type is fully-specified in the first case, the compiler doesn't need to generate any code to resolve the type at run-time. This results in shorter and faster code."

In most instances, this will probably suffice.While the compiler can now do its job perfectly well, there are cases where you might wish that your code could do different things depending on the element type of a.  Usually the best way to achieve this is to wrap your specific operation (here, foo) in a separate function:julia> function sumfoo(c::MySimpleContainer)\n           s = 0\n           for x in c.a\n               s += foo(x)\n           end\n           s\n       end\nsumfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo(x::Integer) = x\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> foo(x::AbstractFloat) = round(x)\nfoo (generic function with 2 methods)This keeps things simple, while allowing the compiler to generate optimized code in all cases.However, there are cases where you may need to declare different versions of the outer function for different element types of a. You could do it like this:function myfun(c::MySimpleContainer{Vector{T}}) where T<:AbstractFloat\n    ...\nend\nfunction myfun(c::MySimpleContainer{Vector{T}}) where T<:Integer\n    ...\nendThis works fine for Vector{T}, but we'd also have to write explicit versions for UnitRange{T} or other abstract types. To prevent such tedium, you can use two parameters in the declaration of MyContainer:julia> mutable struct MyContainer{T, A<:AbstractVector}\n           a::A\n       end\n\njulia> MyContainer(v::AbstractVector) = MyContainer{eltype(v), typeof(v)}(v)\nMyContainer\n\njulia> b = MyContainer(1:5);\n\njulia> typeof(b)\nMyContainer{Int64,UnitRange{Int64}}Note the somewhat surprising fact that T doesn't appear in the declaration of field a, a point that we'll return to in a moment. With this approach, one can write functions such as:julia> function myfunc(c::MyContainer{<:Integer, <:AbstractArray})\n           return c.a[1]+1\n       end\nmyfunc (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> function myfunc(c::MyContainer{<:AbstractFloat})\n           return c.a[1]+2\n       end\nmyfunc (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> function myfunc(c::MyContainer{T,Vector{T}}) where T<:Integer\n           return c.a[1]+3\n       end\nmyfunc (generic function with 3 methods)note: Note\nBecause we can only define MyContainer for A<:AbstractArray, and any unspecified parameters are arbitrary, the first function above could have been written more succinctly as function myfunc{T<:Integer}(c::MyContainer{T})julia> myfunc(MyContainer(1:3))\n2\n\njulia> myfunc(MyContainer(1.0:3))\n3.0\n\njulia> myfunc(MyContainer([1:3;]))\n4As you can see, with this approach it's possible to specialize on both the element type T and the array type A.However, there's one remaining hole: we haven't enforced that A has element type T, so it's perfectly possible to construct an object like this:julia> b = MyContainer{Int64, UnitRange{Float64}}(UnitRange(1.3, 5.0));\n\njulia> typeof(b)\nMyContainer{Int64,UnitRange{Float64}}To prevent this, we can add an inner constructor:julia> mutable struct MyBetterContainer{T<:Real, A<:AbstractVector}\n           a::A\n           MyBetterContainer{T,A}(v::AbstractVector{T}) where {T,A} = new(v)\n       end\n\njulia> MyBetterContainer(v::AbstractVector) = MyBetterContainer{eltype(v),typeof(v)}(v)\nMyBetterContainer\n\njulia> b = MyBetterContainer(UnitRange(1.3, 5.0));\n\njulia> typeof(b)\nMyBetterContainer{Float64,UnitRange{Float64}}\n\njulia> b = MyBetterContainer{Int64, UnitRange{Float64}}(UnitRange(1.3, 5.0));\nERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type UnitRange{Float64} to an object of type MyBetterContainer{Int64,UnitRange{Float64}}\n[...]The inner constructor requires that the element type of A be T."

Such arrays can be created like this:julia> A = fill(5.0, (3, 3))\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0This approach works very well: the compiler can figure out that A is an Array{Float64,2} because it knows the type of the fill value (5.0::Float64) and the dimensionality ((3, 3)::NTuple{2,Int}). This implies that the compiler can generate very efficient code for any future usage of A in the same function.But now let's say you want to write a function that creates a 3×3×... array in arbitrary dimensions; you might be tempted to write a functionjulia> function array3(fillval, N)\n           fill(fillval, ntuple(d->3, N))\n       end\narray3 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> array3(5.0, 2)\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0This works, but (as you can verify for yourself using @code_warntype array3(5.0, 2)) the problem is that the output type cannot be inferred: the argument N is a value of type Int, and type-inference does not (and cannot) predict its value in advance. This means that code using the output of this function has to be conservative, checking the type on each access of A; such code will be very slow.Now, one very good way to solve such problems is by using the function-barrier technique. However, in some cases you might want to eliminate the type-instability altogether.  In such cases, one approach is to pass the dimensionality as a parameter, for example through Val{T} (see \"Value types\"):julia> function array3(fillval, ::Type{Val{N}}) where N\n           fill(fillval, ntuple(d->3, Val{N}))\n       end\narray3 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> array3(5.0, Val{2})\n3×3 Array{Float64,2}:\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0\n 5.0  5.0  5.0Julia has a specialized version of ntuple that accepts a Val{::Int} as the second parameter; by passing N as a type-parameter, you make its \"value\" known to the compiler. Consequently, this version of array3 allows the compiler to predict the return type.However, making use of such techniques can be surprisingly subtle. For example, it would be of no help if you called array3 from a function like this:function call_array3(fillval, n)\n    A = array3(fillval, Val{n})\nendHere, you've created the same problem all over again: the compiler can't guess the type of n, so it doesn't know the type of Val{n}.  Attempting to use Val, but doing so incorrectly, can easily make performance worse in many situations.  (Only in situations where you're effectively combining Val with the function-barrier trick, to make the kernel function more efficient, should code like the above be used.)An example of correct usage of Val would be:function filter3(A::AbstractArray{T,N}) where {T,N}\n    kernel = array3(1, Val{N})\n    filter(A, kernel)\nendIn this example, N is passed as a parameter, so its \"value\" is known to the compiler.  Essentially, Val{T} works only when T is either hard-coded (Val{3}) or already specified in the type-domain."

For example, you might imagine using it to store information, e.g.struct Car{Make,Model}\n    year::Int\n    ...more fields...\nendand then dispatch on objects like Car{:Honda,:Accord}(year, args...).This might be worthwhile when the following are true:You require CPU-intensive processing on each Car, and it becomes vastly more efficient if you know the Make and Model at compile time.\nYou have homogenous lists of the same type of Car to process, so that you can store them all in an Array{Car{:Honda,:Accord},N}.When the latter holds, a function processing such a homogenous array can be productively specialized: Julia knows the type of each element in advance (all objects in the container have the same concrete type), so Julia can \"look up\" the correct method calls when the function is being compiled (obviating the need to check at run-time) and thereby emit efficient code for processing the whole list.When these do not hold, then it's likely that you'll get no benefit; worse, the resulting \"combinatorial explosion of types\" will be counterproductive.  If items[i+1] has a different type than item[i], Julia has to look up the type at run-time, search for the appropriate method in method tables, decide (via type intersection) which one matches, determine whether it has been JIT-compiled yet (and do so if not), and then make the call. In essence, you're asking the full type- system and JIT-compilation machinery to basically execute the equivalent of a switch statement or dictionary lookup in your own code.Some run-time benchmarks comparing (1) type dispatch, (2) dictionary lookup, and (3) a \"switch\" statement can be found on the mailing list.Perhaps even worse than the run-time impact is the compile-time impact: Julia will compile specialized functions for each different Car{Make, Model}; if you have hundreds or thousands of such types, then every function that accepts such an object as a parameter (from a custom get_year function you might write yourself, to the generic push! function in the standard library) will have hundreds or thousands of variants compiled for it.  Each of these increases the size of the cache of compiled code, the length of internal lists of methods, etc.  Excess enthusiasm for values-as-parameters can easily waste enormous resources."

The alternative to column-major ordering is row-major ordering, which is the convention adopted by C and Python (numpy) among other languages. Remembering the ordering of arrays can have significant performance effects when looping over arrays. A rule of thumb to keep in mind is that with column-major arrays, the first index changes most rapidly.

Imagine we wanted to write a function that accepts a Vector and returns a square Matrix with either the rows or the columns filled with copies of the input vector. Assume that it is not important whether rows or columns are filled with these copies (perhaps the rest of the code can be easily adapted accordingly).

In the example above, we could have passed a SubArray rather than an Array, had we so desired.Taken to its extreme, pre-allocation can make your code uglier, so performance measurements and some judgment may be required. However, for \"vectorized\" (element-wise) functions, the convenient syntax x .= f.(y) can be used for in-place operations with fused loops and no temporary arrays (see the dot syntax for vectorizing functions)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Julia has a special dot syntax that converts any scalar function into a \"vectorized\" function call, and any operator into a \"vectorized\" operator, with the special property that nested \"dot calls\" are fusing: they are combined at the syntax level into a single loop, without allocating temporary arrays. If you use .= and similar assignment operators, the result can also be stored in-place in a pre-allocated array (see above).In a linear-algebra context, this means that even though operations like vector + vector and vector * scalar are defined, it can be advantageous to instead use vector .+ vector and vector .* scalar because the resulting loops can be fused with surrounding computations. For example, consider the two functions:f(x) = 3x.^2 + 4x + 7x.^3\n\nfdot(x) = @. 3x^2 + 4x + 7x^3 # equivalent to 3 .* x.^2 .+ 4 .* x .+ 7 .* x.^3Both f and fdot compute the same thing.  However, fdot (defined with the help of the @. macro) is significantly faster when applied to an array:julia> x = rand(10^6);\n\njulia> @time f(x);\n  0.010986 seconds (18 allocations: 53.406 MiB, 11.45% gc time)\n\njulia> @time fdot(x);\n  0.003470 seconds (6 allocations: 7.630 MiB)\n\njulia> @time f.(x);\n  0.003297 seconds (30 allocations: 7.631 MiB)That is, fdot(x) is three times faster and allocates 1/7 the memory of f(x), because each * and + operation in f(x) allocates a new temporary array and executes in a separate loop. (Of course, if you just do f.(x) then it is as fast as fdot(x) in this example, but in many contexts it is more convenient to just sprinkle some dots in your expressions rather than defining a separate function for each vectorized operation.)"

    "text": "In Julia, an array \"slice\" expression like array[1:5, :] creates a copy of that data (except on the left-hand side of an assignment, where array[1:5, :] = ... assigns in-place to that portion of array). If you are doing many operations on the slice, this can be good for performance because it is more efficient to work with a smaller contiguous copy than it would be to index into the original array. On the other hand, if you are just doing a few simple operations on the slice, the cost of the allocation and copy operations can be substantial.An alternative is to create a \"view\" of the array, which is an array object (a SubArray) that actually references the data of the original array in-place, without making a copy.  (If you write to a view, it modifies the original array's data as well.) This can be done for individual slices by calling view(), or more simply for a whole expression or block of code by putting @views in front of that expression.  For example:julia> fcopy(x) = sum(x[2:end-1])\n\njulia> @views fview(x) = sum(x[2:end-1])\n\njulia> x = rand(10^6);\n\njulia> @time fcopy(x);\n  0.003051 seconds (7 allocations: 7.630 MB)\n\njulia> @time fview(x);\n  0.001020 seconds (6 allocations: 224 bytes)Notice both the 3× speedup and the decreased memory allocation of the fview version of the function."

    "text": "Sometimes you can enable better optimization by promising certain program properties.Use @inbounds to eliminate array bounds checking within expressions. Be certain before doing this. If the subscripts are ever out of bounds, you may suffer crashes or silent corruption.\nUse @fastmath to allow floating point optimizations that are correct for real numbers, but lead to differences for IEEE numbers. Be careful when doing this, as this may change numerical results. This corresponds to the -ffast-math option of clang.\nWrite @simd in front of for loops that are amenable to vectorization. This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia.Note: While @simd needs to be placed directly in front of a loop, both @inbounds and @fastmath can be applied to several statements at once, e.g. using begin ... end, or even to a whole function.Here is an example with both @inbounds and @simd markup:function inner(x, y)\n    s = zero(eltype(x))\n    for i=1:length(x)\n        @inbounds s += x[i]*y[i]\n    end\n    s\nend\n\nfunction innersimd(x, y)\n    s = zero(eltype(x))\n    @simd for i=1:length(x)\n        @inbounds s += x[i]*y[i]\n    end\n    s\nend\n\nfunction timeit(n, reps)\n    x = rand(Float32,n)\n    y = rand(Float32,n)\n    s = zero(Float64)\n    time = @elapsed for j in 1:reps\n        s+=inner(x,y)\n    end\n    println(\"GFlop/sec        = \",2.0*n*reps/time*1E-9)\n    time = @elapsed for j in 1:reps\n        s+=innersimd(x,y)\n    end\n    println(\"GFlop/sec (SIMD) = \",2.0*n*reps/time*1E-9)\nend\n\ntimeit(1000,1000)On a computer with a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor, this produces:GFlop/sec        = 1.9467069505224963\nGFlop/sec (SIMD) = 17.578554163920018(GFlop/sec measures the performance, and larger numbers are better.) The range for a @simd for loop should be a one-dimensional range. A variable used for accumulating, such as s in the example, is called a reduction variable. By using @simd, you are asserting several properties of the loop:It is safe to execute iterations in arbitrary or overlapping order, with special consideration for reduction variables.\nFloating-point operations on reduction variables can be reordered, possibly causing different results than without @simd.\nNo iteration ever waits on another iteration to make forward progress.A loop containing break, continue, or @goto will cause a compile-time error.Using @simd merely gives the compiler license to vectorize. Whether it actually does so depends on the compiler. To actually benefit from the current implementation, your loop should have the following additional properties:The loop must be an innermost loop.\nThe loop body must be straight-line code. This is why @inbounds is currently needed for all array accesses. The compiler can sometimes turn short &&, ||, and ?: expressions into straight-line code, if it is safe to evaluate all operands unconditionally. Consider using ifelse() instead of ?: in the loop if it is safe to do so.\nAccesses must have a stride pattern and cannot be \"gathers\" (random-index reads) or \"scatters\" (random-index writes).\nThe stride should be unit stride.\nIn some simple cases, for example with 2-3 arrays accessed in a loop, the LLVM auto-vectorization may kick in automatically, leading to no further speedup with @simd.Here is an example with all three kinds of markup. This program first calculates the finite difference of a one-dimensional array, and then evaluates the L2-norm of the result:function init!(u)\n    n = length(u)\n    dx = 1.0 / (n-1)\n    @fastmath @inbounds @simd for i in 1:n\n        u[i] = sin(2pi*dx*i)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction deriv!(u, du)\n    n = length(u)\n    dx = 1.0 / (n-1)\n    @fastmath @inbounds du[1] = (u[2] - u[1]) / dx\n    @fastmath @inbounds @simd for i in 2:n-1\n        du[i] = (u[i+1] - u[i-1]) / (2*dx)\n    end\n    @fastmath @inbounds du[n] = (u[n] - u[n-1]) / dx\nend\n\nfunction norm(u)\n    n = length(u)\n    T = eltype(u)\n    s = zero(T)\n    @fastmath @inbounds @simd for i in 1:n\n        s += u[i]^2\n    end\n    @fastmath @inbounds return sqrt(s/n)\nend\n\nfunction main()\n    n = 2000\n    u = Array{Float64}(n)\n    init!(u)\n    du = similar(u)\n\n    deriv!(u, du)\n    nu = norm(du)\n\n    @time for i in 1:10^6\n        deriv!(u, du)\n        nu = norm(du)\n    end\n\n    println(nu)\nend\n\nmain()On a computer with a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, this produces:$ julia wave.jl;\nelapsed time: 1.207814709 seconds (0 bytes allocated)\n\n$ julia --math-mode=ieee wave.jl;\nelapsed time: 4.487083643 seconds (0 bytes allocated)Here, the option --math-mode=ieee disables the @fastmath macro, so that we can compare results.In this case, the speedup due to @fastmath is a factor of about 3.7. This is unusually large – in general, the speedup will be smaller. (In this particular example, the working set of the benchmark is small enough to fit into the L1 cache of the processor, so that memory access latency does not play a role, and computing time is dominated by CPU usage. In many real world programs this is not the case.) Also, in this case this optimization does not change the result – in general, the result will be slightly different. In some cases, especially for numerically unstable algorithms, the result can be very different.The annotation @fastmath re-arranges floating point expressions, e.g. changing the order of evaluation, or assuming that certain special cases (inf, nan) cannot occur. In this case (and on this particular computer), the main difference is that the expression 1 / (2*dx) in the function deriv is hoisted out of the loop (i.e. calculated outside the loop), as if one had written idx = 1 / (2*dx). In the loop, the expression ... / (2*dx) then becomes ... * idx, which is much faster to evaluate. Of course, both the actual optimization that is applied by the compiler as well as the resulting speedup depend very much on the hardware. You can examine the change in generated code by using Julia's code_native() function."

A call set_zero_subnormals(true) grants permission for floating-point operations to treat subnormal inputs or outputs as zeros, which may improve performance on some hardware. A call set_zero_subnormals(false) enforces strict IEEE behavior for subnormal numbers.Below is an example where subnormals noticeably impact performance on some hardware:function timestep(b::Vector{T}, a::Vector{T}, Δt::T) where T\n    @assert length(a)==length(b)\n    n = length(b)\n    b[1] = 1                            # Boundary condition\n    for i=2:n-1\n        b[i] = a[i] + (a[i-1] - T(2)*a[i] + a[i+1]) * Δt\n    end\n    b[n] = 0                            # Boundary condition\nend\n\nfunction heatflow(a::Vector{T}, nstep::Integer) where T\n    b = similar(a)\n    for t=1:div(nstep,2)                # Assume nstep is even\n        timestep(b,a,T(0.1))\n        timestep(a,b,T(0.1))\n    end\nend\n\nheatflow(zeros(Float32,10),2)           # Force compilation\nfor trial=1:6\n    a = zeros(Float32,1000)\n    set_zero_subnormals(iseven(trial))  # Odd trials use strict IEEE arithmetic\n    @time heatflow(a,1000)\nendThis example generates many subnormal numbers because the values in a become an exponentially decreasing curve, which slowly flattens out over time.Treating subnormals as zeros should be used with caution, because doing so breaks some identities, such as x-y == 0 implies x == y:julia> x = 3f-38; y = 2f-38;\n\njulia> set_zero_subnormals(true); (x - y, x == y)\n(0.0f0, false)\n\njulia> set_zero_subnormals(false); (x - y, x == y)\n(1.0000001f-38, false)In some applications, an alternative to zeroing subnormal numbers is to inject a tiny bit of noise.

Your code is being presented in form that has been partially digested on its way to generating compiled machine code.  Most of the expressions are annotated by a type, indicated by the ::T (where T might be Float64, for example). The most important characteristic of @code_warntype is that non-concrete types are displayed in red; in the above example, such output is shown in all-caps.The top part of the output summarizes the type information for the different variables internal to the function. You can see that y, one of the variables you created, is a Union{Int64,Float64}, due to the type-instability of pos.  There is another variable, _var4, which you can see also has the same type.The next lines represent the body of f. The lines starting with a number followed by a colon (1:, 2:) are labels, and represent targets for jumps (via goto) in your code.  Looking at the body, you can see that pos has been inlined into f–everything before 2: comes from code defined in pos.Starting at 2:, the variable y is defined, and again annotated as a Union type.  Next, we see that the compiler created the temporary variable _var1 to hold the result of y*x. Because a Float64 times either an Int64 or Float64 yields a Float64, all type-instability ends here. The net result is that f(x::Float64) will not be type-unstable in its output, even if some of the intermediate computations are type-unstable.How you use this information is up to you. Obviously, it would be far and away best to fix pos to be type-stable: if you did so, all of the variables in f would be concrete, and its performance would be optimal.  However, there are circumstances where this kind of ephemeral type instability might not matter too much: for example, if pos is never used in isolation, the fact that f's output is type-stable (for Float64 inputs) will shield later code from the propagating effects of type instability.  This is particularly relevant in cases where fixing the type instability is difficult or impossible: for example, currently it's not possible to infer the return type of an anonymous function.  In such cases, the tips above (e.g., adding type annotations and/or breaking up functions) are your best tools to contain the \"damage\" from type instability.The following examples may help you interpret expressions marked as containing non-leaf types:Function body ending in end::Union{T1,T2})\nInterpretation: function with unstable return type\nSuggestion: make the return value type-stable, even if you have to annotate it\nf(x::T)::Union{T1,T2}\nInterpretation: call to a type-unstable function\nSuggestion: fix the function, or if necessary annotate the return value\n(top(arrayref))(A::Array{Any,1},1)::Any\nInterpretation: accessing elements of poorly-typed arrays\nSuggestion: use arrays with better-defined types, or if necessary annotate the type of individual element accesses\n(top(getfield))(A::ArrayContainer{Float64},:data)::Array{Float64,N}\nInterpretation: getting a field that is of non-leaf type. In this case, ArrayContainer had a field data::Array{T}. But Array needs the dimension N, too, to be a concrete type.\nSuggestion: use concrete types like Array{T,3} or Array{T,N}, where N is now a parameter of ArrayContainer"

    "text": "Writing code as a series of steps at the top level is a quick way to get started solving a problem, but you should try to divide a program into functions as soon as possible. Functions are more reusable and testable, and clarify what steps are being done and what their inputs and outputs are. Furthermore, code inside functions tends to run much faster than top level code, due to how Julia's compiler works.It is also worth emphasizing that functions should take arguments, instead of operating directly on global variables (aside from constants like pi)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Code should be as generic as possible. Instead of writing:convert(Complex{Float64}, x)it's better to use available generic functions:complex(float(x))The second version will convert x to an appropriate type, instead of always the same type.This style point is especially relevant to function arguments. For example, don't declare an argument to be of type Int or Int32 if it really could be any integer, expressed with the abstract type Integer. In fact, in many cases you can omit the argument type altogether, unless it is needed to disambiguate from other method definitions, since a MethodError will be thrown anyway if a type is passed that does not support any of the requisite operations. (This is known as duck typing.)For example, consider the following definitions of a function addone that returns one plus its argument:addone(x::Int) = x + 1                 # works only for Int\naddone(x::Integer) = x + oneunit(x)    # any integer type\naddone(x::Number) = x + oneunit(x)     # any numeric type\naddone(x) = x + oneunit(x)             # any type supporting + and oneunitThe last definition of addone handles any type supporting oneunit (which returns 1 in the same type as x, which avoids unwanted type promotion) and the + function with those arguments. The key thing to realize is that there is no performance penalty to defining only the general addone(x) = x + oneunit(x), because Julia will automatically compile specialized versions as needed. For example, the first time you call addone(12), Julia will automatically compile a specialized addone function for x::Int arguments, with the call to oneunit replaced by its inlined value 1. Therefore, the first three definitions of addone above are completely redundant with the fourth definition."

In some cases, you can get away with type piracy with little ill effect. In extreme cases, however, you can even crash Julia (e.g. if your method extension or redefinition causes invalid input to be passed to a ccall). Type piracy can complicate reasoning about code, and may introduce incompatibilities that are hard to predict and diagnose.As an example, suppose you wanted to define multiplication on symbols in a module:module A\nimport Base.*\n*(x::Symbol, y::Symbol) = Symbol(x,y)\nendThe problem is that now any other module that uses Base.* will also see this definition. Since Symbol is defined in Base and is used by other modules, this can change the behavior of unrelated code unexpectedly. There are several alternatives here, including using a different function name, or wrapping the Symbols in another type that you define.Sometimes, coupled packages may engage in type piracy to separate features from definitions, especially when the packages were designed by collaborating authors, and when the definitions are reusable. For example, one package might provide some types useful for working with colors; another package could define methods for those types that enable conversions between color spaces. Another example might be a package that acts as a thin wrapper for some C code, which another package might then pirate to implement a higher-level, Julia-friendly API."

Similarly, Rational literals are less type disruptive than Float64 literals, but more disruptive than Ints:julia> h(x) = 2//1 * x\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> h(1//2)\n1//1\n\njulia> h(1/2)\n1.0\n\njulia> h(1)\n2//1Thus, use Int literals when possible, with Rational{Int} for literal non-integer numbers, in order to make it easier to use your code."

    "title": "Why does Julia use native machine integer arithmetic?",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Julia uses machine arithmetic for integer computations. This means that the range of Int values is bounded and wraps around at either end so that adding, subtracting and multiplying integers can overflow or underflow, leading to some results that can be unsettling at first:julia> typemax(Int)\n9223372036854775807\n\njulia> ans+1\n-9223372036854775808\n\njulia> -ans\n-9223372036854775808\n\njulia> 2*ans\n0Clearly, this is far from the way mathematical integers behave, and you might think it less than ideal for a high-level programming language to expose this to the user. For numerical work where efficiency and transparency are at a premium, however, the alternatives are worse.One alternative to consider would be to check each integer operation for overflow and promote results to bigger integer types such as Int128 or BigInt in the case of overflow. Unfortunately, this introduces major overhead on every integer operation (think incrementing a loop counter) – it requires emitting code to perform run-time overflow checks after arithmetic instructions and branches to handle potential overflows. Worse still, this would cause every computation involving integers to be type-unstable. As we mentioned above, type-stability is crucial for effective generation of efficient code. If you can't count on the results of integer operations being integers, it's impossible to generate fast, simple code the way C and Fortran compilers do.A variation on this approach, which avoids the appearance of type instability is to merge the Int and BigInt types into a single hybrid integer type, that internally changes representation when a result no longer fits into the size of a machine integer. While this superficially avoids type-instability at the level of Julia code, it just sweeps the problem under the rug by foisting all of the same difficulties onto the C code implementing this hybrid integer type. This approach can be made to work and can even be made quite fast in many cases, but has several drawbacks. One problem is that the in-memory representation of integers and arrays of integers no longer match the natural representation used by C, Fortran and other languages with native machine integers. Thus, to interoperate with those languages, we would ultimately need to introduce native integer types anyway. Any unbounded representation of integers cannot have a fixed number of bits, and thus cannot be stored inline in an array with fixed-size slots – large integer values will always require separate heap-allocated storage. And of course, no matter how clever a hybrid integer implementation one uses, there are always performance traps – situations where performance degrades unexpectedly. Complex representation, lack of interoperability with C and Fortran, the inability to represent integer arrays without additional heap storage, and unpredictable performance characteristics make even the cleverest hybrid integer implementations a poor choice for high-performance numerical work.An alternative to using hybrid integers or promoting to BigInts is to use saturating integer arithmetic, where adding to the largest integer value leaves it unchanged and likewise for subtracting from the smallest integer value. This is precisely what Matlab™ does:>> int64(9223372036854775807)\n\nans =\n\n  9223372036854775807\n\n>> int64(9223372036854775807) + 1\n\nans =\n\n  9223372036854775807\n\n>> int64(-9223372036854775808)\n\nans =\n\n -9223372036854775808\n\n>> int64(-9223372036854775808) - 1\n\nans =\n\n -9223372036854775808At first blush, this seems reasonable enough since 9223372036854775807 is much closer to 9223372036854775808 than -9223372036854775808 is and integers are still represented with a fixed size in a natural way that is compatible with C and Fortran. Saturated integer arithmetic, however, is deeply problematic. The first and most obvious issue is that this is not the way machine integer arithmetic works, so implementing saturated operations requires emitting instructions after each machine integer operation to check for underflow or overflow and replace the result with typemin(Int) or typemax(Int) as appropriate. This alone expands each integer operation from a single, fast instruction into half a dozen instructions, probably including branches. Ouch. But it gets worse – saturating integer arithmetic isn't associative. Consider this Matlab computation:>> n = int64(2)^62\n4611686018427387904\n\n>> n + (n - 1)\n9223372036854775807\n\n>> (n + n) - 1\n9223372036854775806This makes it hard to write many basic integer algorithms since a lot of common techniques depend on the fact that machine addition with overflow is associative. Consider finding the midpoint between integer values lo and hi in Julia using the expression (lo + hi) >>> 1:julia> n = 2^62\n4611686018427387904\n\njulia> (n + 2n) >>> 1\n6917529027641081856See? No problem. That's the correct midpoint between 2^62 and 2^63, despite the fact that n + 2n is -4611686018427387904. Now try it in Matlab:>> (n + 2*n)/2\n\nans =\n\n  4611686018427387904Oops. Adding a >>> operator to Matlab wouldn't help, because saturation that occurs when adding n and 2n has already destroyed the information necessary to compute the correct midpoint.Not only is lack of associativity unfortunate for programmers who cannot rely it for techniques like this, but it also defeats almost anything compilers might want to do to optimize integer arithmetic. For example, since Julia integers use normal machine integer arithmetic, LLVM is free to aggressively optimize simple little functions like f(k) = 5k-1. The machine code for this function is just this:julia> code_native(f, Tuple{Int})\n  .text\nFilename: none\n  pushq %rbp\n  movq  %rsp, %rbp\nSource line: 1\n  leaq  -1(%rdi,%rdi,4), %rax\n  popq  %rbp\n  retq\n  nopl  (%rax,%rax)The actual body of the function is a single leaq instruction, which computes the integer multiply and add at once. This is even more beneficial when f gets inlined into another function:julia> function g(k, n)\n           for i = 1:n\n               k = f(k)\n           end\n           return k\n       end\ng (generic function with 1 methods)\n\njulia> code_native(g, Tuple{Int,Int})\n  .text\nFilename: none\n  pushq %rbp\n  movq  %rsp, %rbp\nSource line: 2\n  testq %rsi, %rsi\n  jle L26\n  nopl  (%rax)\nSource line: 3\nL16:\n  leaq  -1(%rdi,%rdi,4), %rdi\nSource line: 2\n  decq  %rsi\n  jne L16\nSource line: 5\nL26:\n  movq  %rdi, %rax\n  popq  %rbp\n  retq\n  nopSince the call to f gets inlined, the loop body ends up being just a single leaq instruction. Next, consider what happens if we make the number of loop iterations fixed:julia> function g(k)\n           for i = 1:10\n               k = f(k)\n           end\n           return k\n       end\ng (generic function with 2 methods)\n\njulia> code_native(g,(Int,))\n  .text\nFilename: none\n  pushq %rbp\n  movq  %rsp, %rbp\nSource line: 3\n  imulq $9765625, %rdi, %rax    # imm = 0x9502F9\n  addq  $-2441406, %rax         # imm = 0xFFDABF42\nSource line: 5\n  popq  %rbp\n  retq\n  nopw  %cs:(%rax,%rax)Because the compiler knows that integer addition and multiplication are associative and that multiplication distributes over addition – neither of which is true of saturating arithmetic – it can optimize the entire loop down to just a multiply and an add. Saturated arithmetic completely defeats this kind of optimization since associativity and distributivity can fail at each loop iteration, causing different outcomes depending on which iteration the failure occurs in. The compiler can unroll the loop, but it cannot algebraically reduce multiple operations into fewer equivalent operations.The most reasonable alternative to having integer arithmetic silently overflow is to do checked arithmetic everywhere, raising errors when adds, subtracts, and multiplies overflow, producing values that are not value-correct. In this blog post, Dan Luu analyzes this and finds that rather than the trivial cost that this approach should in theory have, it ends up having a substantial cost due to compilers (LLVM and GCC) not gracefully optimizing around the added overflow checks. If this improves in the future, we could consider defaulting to checked integer arithmetic in Julia, but for now, we have to live with the possibility of overflow."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "There is only one difference, and on the surface (syntax-wise) it may seem very minor. The difference between using and importall is that with using you need to say function Foo.bar(.. to extend module Foo's function bar with a new method, but with importall or import Foo.bar, you only need to say function bar(... and it automatically extends module Foo's function bar.If you use importall, then function Foo.bar(... and function bar(... become equivalent. If you use using, then they are different.The reason this is important enough to have been given separate syntax is that you don't want to accidentally extend a function that you didn't know existed, because that could easily cause a bug. This is most likely to happen with a method that takes a common type like a string or integer, because both you and the other module could define a method to handle such a common type. If you use importall, then you'll replace the other module's implementation of bar(s::AbstractString) with your new implementation, which could easily do something completely different (and break all/many future usages of the other functions in module Foo that depend on calling bar)."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Unlike many languages (for example, C and Java), Julia does not have a \"null\" value. When a reference (variable, object field, or array element) is uninitialized, accessing it will immediately throw an error. This situation can be detected using the isdefined function.Some functions are used only for their side effects, and do not need to return a value. In these cases, the convention is to return the value nothing, which is just a singleton object of type Void. This is an ordinary type with no fields; there is nothing special about it except for this convention, and that the REPL does not print anything for it. Some language constructs that would not otherwise have a value also yield nothing, for example if false; end.For situations where a value exists only sometimes (for example, missing statistical data), it is best to use the Nullable{T} type, which allows specifying the type of a missing value.The empty tuple (()) is another form of nothingness. But, it should not really be thought of as nothing but rather a tuple of zero values.In code written for Julia prior to version 0.4 you may occasionally see None, which is quite different. It is the empty (or \"bottom\") type, a type with no values and no subtypes (except itself). This is now written as Union{} (an empty union type). You will generally not need to use this type."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "In Julia, x += y gets replaced during parsing by x = x + y. For arrays, this has the consequence that, rather than storing the result in the same location in memory as x, it allocates a new array to store the result.While this behavior might surprise some, the choice is deliberate. The main reason is the presence of immutable objects within Julia, which cannot change their value once created.  Indeed, a number is an immutable object; the statements x = 5; x += 1 do not modify the meaning of 5, they modify the value bound to x. For an immutable, the only way to change the value is to reassign it.To amplify a bit further, consider the following function:function power_by_squaring(x, n::Int)\n    ispow2(n) || error(\"This implementation only works for powers of 2\")\n    while n >= 2\n        x *= x\n        n >>= 1\n    end\n    x\nendAfter a call like x = 5; y = power_by_squaring(x, 4), you would get the expected result: x == 5 && y == 625.  However, now suppose that *=, when used with matrices, instead mutated the left hand side.  There would be two problems:For general square matrices, A = A*B cannot be implemented without temporary storage: A[1,1] gets computed and stored on the left hand side before you're done using it on the right hand side.\nSuppose you were willing to allocate a temporary for the computation (which would eliminate most of the point of making *= work in-place); if you took advantage of the mutability of x, then this function would behave differently for mutable vs. immutable inputs. In particular, for immutable x, after the call you'd have (in general) y != x, but for mutable x you'd have y == x.Because supporting generic programming is deemed more important than potential performance optimizations that can be achieved by other means (e.g., using explicit loops), operators like += and *= work by rebinding new values."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Although MATLAB users may find Julia's syntax familiar, Julia is not a MATLAB clone. There are major syntactic and functional differences. The following are some noteworthy differences that may trip up Julia users accustomed to MATLAB:Julia arrays are indexed with square brackets, A[i,j].\nJulia arrays are assigned by reference. After A=B, changing elements of B will modify A as well.\nJulia values are passed and assigned by reference. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller.\nJulia does not automatically grow arrays in an assignment statement. Whereas in MATLAB a(4) = 3.2 can create the array a = [0 0 0 3.2] and a(5) = 7 can grow it into a = [0 0 0 3.2 7], the corresponding Julia statement a[5] = 7 throws an error if the length of a is less than 5 or if this statement is the first use of the identifier a. Julia has push!() and append!(), which grow Vectors much more efficiently than MATLAB's a(end+1) = val.\nThe imaginary unit sqrt(-1) is represented in Julia as im, not i or j as in MATLAB.\nIn Julia, literal numbers without a decimal point (such as 42) create integers instead of floating point numbers. Arbitrarily large integer literals are supported. As a result, some operations such as 2^-1 will throw a domain error as the result is not an integer (see the FAQ entry on domain errors for details).\nIn Julia, multiple values are returned and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = (1, 2) or a, b = 1, 2. MATLAB's nargout, which is often used in MATLAB to do optional work based on the number of returned values, does not exist in Julia. Instead, users can use optional and keyword arguments to achieve similar capabilities.\nJulia has true one-dimensional arrays. Column vectors are of size N, not Nx1. For example, rand(N) makes a 1-dimensional array.\nIn Julia, [x,y,z] will always construct a 3-element array containing x, y and z.\nTo concatenate in the first (\"vertical\") dimension use either vcat(x,y,z) or separate with semicolons ([x; y; z]).\nTo concatenate in the second (\"horizontal\") dimension use either hcat(x,y,z) or separate with spaces ([x y z]).\nTo construct block matrices (concatenating in the first two dimensions), use either hvcat() or combine spaces and semicolons ([a b; c d]).\nIn Julia, a:b and a:b:c construct Range objects. To construct a full vector like in MATLAB, use collect(a:b). Generally, there is no need to call collect though. Range will act like a normal array in most cases but is more efficient because it lazily computes its values. This pattern of creating specialized objects instead of full arrays is used frequently, and is also seen in functions such as linspace, or with iterators such as enumerate, and zip. The special objects can mostly be used as if they were normal arrays.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression or the return keyword instead of listing the names of variables to return in the function definition (see The return Keyword for details).\nA Julia script may contain any number of functions, and all definitions will be externally visible when the file is loaded. Function definitions can be loaded from files outside the current working directory.\nIn Julia, reductions such as sum(), prod(), and max() are performed over every element of an array when called with a single argument, as in sum(A), even if A has more than one dimension.\nIn Julia, functions such as sort() that operate column-wise by default (sort(A) is equivalent to sort(A,1)) do not have special behavior for 1xN arrays; the argument is returned unmodified since it still performs sort(A,1). To sort a 1xN matrix like a vector, use sort(A,2).\nIn Julia, if A is a 2-dimensional array, fft(A) computes a 2D FFT. In particular, it is not equivalent to fft(A,1), which computes a 1D FFT acting column-wise.\nIn Julia, parentheses must be used to call a function with zero arguments, like in tic() and toc().\nJulia discourages the used of semicolons to end statements. The results of statements are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println() or @printf() can be used to print specific output.\nIn Julia, if A and B are arrays, logical comparison operations like A == B do not return an array of booleans. Instead, use A .== B, and similarly for the other boolean operators like <, > and =.\nIn Julia, the operators &, |, and ⊻ (xor) perform the bitwise operations equivalent to and, or, and xor respectively in MATLAB, and have precedence similar to Python's bitwise operators (unlike C). They can operate on scalars or element-wise across arrays and can be used to combine logical arrays, but note the difference in order of operations: parentheses may be required (e.g., to select elements of A equal to 1 or 2 use (A .== 1) | (A .== 2)).\nIn Julia, the elements of a collection can be passed as arguments to a function using the splat operator ..., as in xs=[1,2]; f(xs...).\nJulia's svd() returns singular values as a vector instead of as a dense diagonal matrix.\nIn Julia, ... is not used to continue lines of code. Instead, incomplete expressions automatically continue onto the next line.\nIn both Julia and MATLAB, the variable ans is set to the value of the last expression issued in an interactive session. In Julia, unlike MATLAB, ans is not set when Julia code is run in non-interactive mode.\nJulia's types do not support dynamically adding fields at runtime, unlike MATLAB's classes. Instead, use a Dict.\nIn Julia each module has its own global scope/namespace, whereas in MATLAB there is just one global scope.\nIn MATLAB, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x(x>3) or in the statement x(x>3) = [] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter() and filter!(), allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter!() reduces the use of temporary arrays.\nThe analogue of extracting (or \"dereferencing\") all elements of a cell array, e.g. in vertcat(A{:}) in MATLAB, is written using the splat operator in Julia, e.g. as vcat(A...)."

    "text": "One of Julia's goals is to provide an effective language for data analysis and statistical programming. For users coming to Julia from R, these are some noteworthy differences:Julia's single quotes enclose characters, not strings.\nJulia can create substrings by indexing into strings. In R, strings must be converted into character vectors before creating substrings.\nIn Julia, like Python but unlike R, strings can be created with triple quotes \"\"\" ... \"\"\". This syntax is convenient for constructing strings that contain line breaks.\nIn Julia, varargs are specified using the splat operator ..., which always follows the name of a specific variable, unlike R, for which ... can occur in isolation.\nIn Julia, modulus is mod(a, b), not a %% b. % in Julia is the remainder operator.\nIn Julia, not all data structures support logical indexing. Furthermore, logical indexing in Julia is supported only with vectors of length equal to the object being indexed. For example:\nIn R, c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE)] is equivalent to c(1, 3).\nIn R, c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)] is equivalent to c(1, 3).\nIn Julia, [1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false]] throws a BoundsError.\nIn Julia, [1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false, true, false]] produces [1, 3].\nLike many languages, Julia does not always allow operations on vectors of different lengths, unlike R where the vectors only need to share a common index range.  For example, c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(1, 2) is valid R but the equivalent [1, 2, 3, 4] + [1, 2] will throw an error in Julia.\nJulia's map() takes the function first, then its arguments, unlike lapply(<structure>, function, ...) in R. Similarly Julia's equivalent of apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...) in R is mapslices() where the function is the first argument.\nMultivariate apply in R, e.g. mapply(choose, 11:13, 1:3), can be written as broadcast(binomial, 11:13, 1:3) in Julia. Equivalently Julia offers a shorter dot syntax for vectorizing functions binomial.(11:13, 1:3).\nJulia uses end to denote the end of conditional blocks, like if, loop blocks, like while/ for, and functions. In lieu of the one-line if ( cond ) statement, Julia allows statements of the form if cond; statement; end, cond && statement and !cond || statement. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. cond && (x = value).\nIn Julia, <-, <<- and -> are not assignment operators.\nJulia's -> creates an anonymous function, like Python.\nJulia constructs vectors using brackets. Julia's [1, 2, 3] is the equivalent of R's c(1, 2, 3).\nJulia's * operator can perform matrix multiplication, unlike in R. If A and B are matrices, then A * B denotes a matrix multiplication in Julia, equivalent to R's A %*% B. In R, this same notation would perform an element-wise (Hadamard) product. To get the element-wise multiplication operation, you need to write A .* B in Julia.\nJulia performs matrix transposition using the .' operator and conjugated transposition using the ' operator. Julia's A.' is therefore equivalent to R's t(A).\nJulia does not require parentheses when writing if statements or for/while loops: use for i in [1, 2, 3] instead of for (i in c(1, 2, 3)) and if i == 1 instead of if (i == 1).\nJulia does not treat the numbers 0 and 1 as Booleans. You cannot write if (1) in Julia, because if statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write if true, if Bool(1), or if 1==1.\nJulia does not provide nrow and ncol. Instead, use size(M, 1) for nrow(M) and size(M, 2) for ncol(M).\nJulia is careful to distinguish scalars, vectors and matrices.  In R, 1 and c(1) are the same. In Julia, they can not be used interchangeably. One potentially confusing result of this is that x' * y for vectors x and y is a 1-element vector, not a scalar. To get a scalar, use dot(x, y).\nJulia's diag() and diagm() are not like R's.\nJulia cannot assign to the results of function calls on the left hand side of an assignment operation: you cannot write diag(M) = ones(n).\nJulia discourages populating the main namespace with functions. Most statistical functionality for Julia is found in packages under the JuliaStats organization. For example:\nFunctions pertaining to probability distributions are provided by the Distributions package.\nThe DataFrames package provides data frames.\nGeneralized linear models are provided by the GLM package.\nJulia provides tuples and real hash tables, but not R-style lists. When returning multiple items, you should typically use a tuple: instead of list(a = 1, b = 2), use (1, 2).\nJulia encourages users to write their own types, which are easier to use than S3 or S4 objects in R. Julia's multiple dispatch system means that table(x::TypeA) and table(x::TypeB) act like R's table.TypeA(x) and table.TypeB(x).\nIn Julia, values are passed and assigned by reference. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller. This is very different from R and allows new functions to operate on large data structures much more efficiently.\nIn Julia, vectors and matrices are concatenated using hcat(), vcat() and hvcat(), not c, rbind and cbind like in R.\nIn Julia, a range like a:b is not shorthand for a vector like in R, but is a specialized Range that is used for iteration without high memory overhead. To convert a range into a vector, use collect(a:b).\nJulia's max() and min() are the equivalent of pmax and pmin respectively in R, but both arguments need to have the same dimensions.  While maximum() and minimum() replace max and min in R, there are important differences.\nJulia's sum(), prod(), maximum(), and minimum() are different from their counterparts in R. They all accept one or two arguments. The first argument is an iterable collection such as an array.  If there is a second argument, then this argument indicates the dimensions, over which the operation is carried out.  For instance, let A=[[1 2],[3 4]] in Julia and B=rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)) be the same matrix in R.  Then sum(A) gives the same result as sum(B), but sum(A, 1) is a row vector containing the sum over each column and sum(A, 2) is a column vector containing the sum over each row.  This contrasts to the behavior of R, where sum(B,1)=11 and sum(B,2)=12.  If the second argument is a vector, then it specifies all the dimensions over which the sum is performed, e.g., sum(A,[1,2])=10.  It should be noted that there is no error checking regarding the second argument.\nJulia has several functions that can mutate their arguments. For example, it has both sort() and sort!().\nIn R, performance requires vectorization. In Julia, almost the opposite is true: the best performing code is often achieved by using devectorized loops.\nJulia is eagerly evaluated and does not support R-style lazy evaluation. For most users, this means that there are very few unquoted expressions or column names.\nJulia does not support the NULL type.\nJulia lacks the equivalent of R's assign or get.\nIn Julia, return does not require parentheses.\nIn R, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x[x>3] or in the statement x = x[x>3] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter() and filter!(), allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter!() reduces the use of temporary arrays."

    "text": "Julia requires end to end a block. Unlike Python, Julia has no pass keyword.\nIn Julia, indexing of arrays, strings, etc. is 1-based not 0-based.\nJulia's slice indexing includes the last element, unlike in Python. a[2:3] in Julia is a[1:3] in Python.\nJulia does not support negative indexes. In particular, the last element of a list or array is indexed with end in Julia, not -1 as in Python.\nJulia's for, if, while, etc. blocks are terminated by the end keyword. Indentation level is not significant as it is in Python.\nJulia has no line continuation syntax: if, at the end of a line, the input so far is a complete expression, it is considered done; otherwise the input continues. One way to force an expression to continue is to wrap it in parentheses.\nJulia arrays are column major (Fortran ordered) whereas NumPy arrays are row major (C-ordered) by default. To get optimal performance when looping over arrays, the order of the loops should be reversed in Julia relative to NumPy (see relevant section of Performance Tips).\nJulia's updating operators (e.g. +=, -=, ...) are not in-place whereas NumPy's are. This means A = ones(4); B = A; B += 3 doesn't change values in A, it rather rebinds the name B to the result of the right- hand side B = B + 3, which is a new array. Use B[:] += 3, explicit loops, or InplaceOps.jl.\nJulia evaluates default values of function arguments every time the method is invoked, unlike in Python where the default values are evaluated only once when the function is defined. For example, the function f(x=rand()) = x returns a new random number every time it is invoked without argument. On the other hand, the function g(x=[1,2]) = push!(x,3) returns [1,2,3] every time it is called as g().\nIn Julia % is the remainder operator, whereas in Python it is the modulus."

    "text": "Julia arrays are indexed with square brackets, and can have more than one dimension A[i,j]. This syntax is not just syntactic sugar for a reference to a pointer or address as in C/C++. See the Julia documentation for the syntax for array construction (it has changed between versions).\nIn Julia, indexing of arrays, strings, etc. is 1-based not 0-based.\nJulia arrays are assigned by reference. After A=B, changing elements of B will modify A as well. Updating operators like += do not operate in-place, they are equivalent to A = A + B which rebinds the left-hand side to the result of the right-hand side expression.\nJulia arrays are column major (Fortran ordered) whereas C/C++ arrays are row major ordered by default. To get optimal performance when looping over arrays, the order of the loops should be reversed in Julia relative to C/C++ (see relevant section of Performance Tips).\nJulia values are passed and assigned by reference. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller.\nIn Julia, whitespace is significant, unlike C/C++, so care must be taken when adding/removing whitespace from a Julia program.\nIn Julia, literal numbers without a decimal point (such as 42) create signed integers, of type Int, but literals too large to fit in the machine word size will automatically be promoted to a larger size type, such as Int64 (if Int is Int32), Int128, or the arbitrarily large BigInt type. There are no numeric literal suffixes, such as L, LL, U, UL, ULL to indicate unsigned and/or signed vs. unsigned. Decimal literals are always signed, and hexadecimal literals (which start with 0x like C/C++), are unsigned. Hexadecimal literals also, unlike C/C++/Java and unlike decimal literals in Julia, have a type based on the length of the literal, including leading 0s.  For example, 0x0 and 0x00 have type UInt8, 0x000 and 0x0000 have type UInt16, then literals with 5 to 8 hex digits have type UInt32, 9 to 16 hex digits type UInt64 and 17 to 32 hex digits type UInt128. This needs to be taken into account when defining hexadecimal masks, for example ~0xf == 0xf0 is very different from ~0x000f == 0xfff0. 64 bit Float64 and 32 bit Float32 bit literals are expressed as 1.0 and 1.0f0 respectively. Floating point literals are rounded (and not promoted to the BigFloat type) if they can not be exactly represented.  Floating point literals are closer in behavior to C/C++. Octal (prefixed with 0o) and binary (prefixed with 0b) literals are also treated as unsigned.\nString literals can be delimited with either \"  or \"\"\", \"\"\" delimited literals can contain \" characters without quoting it like \"\\\"\" String literals can have values of other variables or expressions interpolated into them, indicated by $variablename or $(expression), which evaluates the variable name or the expression in the context of the function.\n// indicates a Rational number, and not a single-line comment (which is # in Julia)\n#= indicates the start of a multiline comment, and =# ends it.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression(s) or the return keyword.  Multiple values can be returned from functions and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = myfunction() or a, b = myfunction(), instead of having to pass pointers to values as one would have to do in C/C++ (i.e. a = myfunction(&b).\nJulia does not require the use of semicolons to end statements. The results of expressions are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt, i.e. the REPL), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println() or @printf() can be used to print specific output. In the REPL, ; can be used to suppress output. ; also has a different meaning within [ ], something to watch out for. ; can be used to separate expressions on a single line, but are not strictly necessary in many cases, and are more an aid to readability.\nIn Julia, the operator ⊻ (xor) performs the bitwise XOR operation, i.e. ^ in C/C++.  Also, the bitwise operators do not have the same precedence as C/++, so parenthesis may be required.\nJulia's ^ is exponentiation (pow), not bitwise XOR as in C/C++ (use ⊻, or xor, in Julia)\nJulia has two right-shift operators, >> and >>>.  >>> performs an arithmetic shift, >> always performs a logical shift, unlike C/C++, where the meaning of >> depends on the type of the value being shifted.\nJulia's -> creates an anonymous function, it does not access a member via a pointer.\nJulia does not require parentheses when writing if statements or for/while loops: use for i in [1, 2, 3] instead of for (int i=1; i <= 3; i++) and if i == 1 instead of if (i == 1).\nJulia does not treat the numbers 0 and 1 as Booleans. You cannot write if (1) in Julia, because if statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write if true, if Bool(1), or if 1==1.\nJulia uses end to denote the end of conditional blocks, like if, loop blocks, like while/ for, and functions. In lieu of the one-line if ( cond ) statement, Julia allows statements of the form if cond; statement; end, cond && statement and !cond || statement. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. cond && (x = value), because of the operator precedence.\nJulia has no line continuation syntax: if, at the end of a line, the input so far is a complete expression, it is considered done; otherwise the input continues. One way to force an expression to continue is to wrap it in parentheses.\nJulia macros operate on parsed expressions, rather than the text of the program, which allows them to perform sophisticated transformations of Julia code. Macro names start with the @ character, and have both a function-like syntax, @mymacro(arg1, arg2, arg3), and a statement-like syntax, @mymacro arg1 arg2 arg3. The forms are interchangable; the function-like form is particularly useful if the macro appears within another expression, and is often clearest. The statement-like form is often used to annotate blocks, as in the parallel for construct: @parallel for i in 1:n; #= body =#; end. Where the end of the macro construct may be unclear, use the function-like form.\nJulia now has an enumeration type, expressed using the macro @enum(name, value1, value2, ...) For example: @enum(Fruit, banana=1, apple, pear)\nBy convention, functions that modify their arguments have a ! at the end of the name, for example push!.\nIn C++, by default, you have static dispatch, i.e. you need to annotate a function as virtual, in order to have dynamic dispatch. On the other hand, in Julia every method is \"virtual\" (although it's more general than that since methods are dispatched on every argument type, not only this, using the most-specific-declaration rule)."

Define these two functions for custom types to override how they are stored in a hash table.ObjectIdDict is a special hash table where the keys are always object identities.WeakKeyDict is a hash table implementation where the keys are weak references to objects, and thus may be garbage collected even when referenced in a hash table.Dicts can be created by passing pair objects constructed with =>() to a Dict constructor: Dict(\"A\"=>1, \"B\"=>2). This call will attempt to infer type information from the keys and values (i.e. this example creates a Dict{String, Int64}). To explicitly specify types use the syntax Dict{KeyType,ValueType}(...). For example, Dict{String,Int32}(\"A\"=>1, \"B\"=>2).Associative collections may also be created with generators. For example, Dict(i => f(i) for i = 1:10).Given a dictionary D, the syntax D[x] returns the value of key x (if it exists) or throws an error, and D[x] = y stores the key-value pair x => y in D (replacing any existing value for the key x).  Multiple arguments to D[...] are converted to tuples; for example, the syntax D[x,y]  is equivalent to D[(x,y)], i.e. it refers to the value keyed by the tuple (x,y).Base.Dict\nBase.ObjectIdDict\nBase.WeakKeyDict\nBase.haskey\nBase.get(::Any, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.get\nBase.get!(::Any, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.get!(::Function, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.getkey\nBase.delete!\nBase.pop!(::Any, ::Any, ::Any)\nBase.keys\nBase.values\nBase.merge\nBase.merge!\nBase.sizehint!\nBase.keytype\nBase.valtypeFully implemented by:ObjectIdDict\nDict\nWeakKeyDictPartially implemented by:IntSet\nSet\nEnvHash\nArray\nBitArray"

Higher performance is usually possible by increasing number of threads. Use FFTW.set_num_threads(Sys.CPU_CORES) to use as many threads as cores on your system.\nThis performs a multidimensional FFT by default. FFT libraries in other languages such as Python and Octave perform a one-dimensional FFT along the first non-singleton dimension of the array. This is worth noting while performing comparisons.

Returns an object P which represents the linear operator computed by the FFT, and which contains all of the information needed to compute fft(A, dims) quickly.\n\nTo apply P to an array A, use P * A; in general, the syntax for applying plans is much like that of matrices.  (A plan can only be applied to arrays of the same size as the A for which the plan was created.)  You can also apply a plan with a preallocated output array Â by calling A_mul_B!(Â, plan, A).  (For A_mul_B!, however, the input array A must be a complex floating-point array like the output Â.) You can compute the inverse-transform plan by inv(P) and apply the inverse plan with P \\ Â (the inverse plan is cached and reused for subsequent calls to inv or \\), and apply the inverse plan to a pre-allocated output array A with A_ldiv_B!(A, P, Â).\n\nThe flags argument is a bitwise-or of FFTW planner flags, defaulting to FFTW.ESTIMATE. e.g. passing FFTW.MEASURE or FFTW.PATIENT will instead spend several seconds (or more) benchmarking different possible FFT algorithms and picking the fastest one; see the FFTW manual for more information on planner flags.

To use only the local process and distribute over tasks, specify distributed=false. This is equivalent to using asyncmap. For example, pmap(f, c; distributed=false) is equivalent to asyncmap(f,c; ntasks=()->nworkers())\n\npmap can also use a mix of processes and tasks via the batch_size argument. For batch sizes greater than 1, the collection is processed in multiple batches, each of length batch_size or less. A batch is sent as a single request to a free worker, where a local asyncmap processes elements from the batch using multiple concurrent tasks.\n\nAny error stops pmap from processing the remainder of the collection. To override this behavior you can specify an error handling function via argument on_error which takes in a single argument, i.e., the exception. The function can stop the processing by rethrowing the error, or, to continue, return any value which is then returned inline with the results to the caller.\n\nConsider the following two examples. The first one returns the exception object inline, the second a 0 in place of any exception:\n\njulia> pmap(x->iseven(x) ? error(\"foo\") : x, 1:4; on_error=identity)\n4-element Array{Any,1}:\n 1\n  ErrorException(\"foo\")\n 3\n  ErrorException(\"foo\")\n\njulia> pmap(x->iseven(x) ? error(\"foo\") : x, 1:4; on_error=ex->0)\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 0\n 3\n 0\n\nErrors can also be handled by retrying failed computations. Keyword arguments retry_delays and retry_check are passed through to retry as keyword arguments delays and check respectively. If batching is specified, and an entire batch fails, all items in the batch are retried.\n\nNote that if both on_error and retry_delays are specified, the on_error hook is called before retrying. If on_error does not throw (or rethrow) an exception, the element will not be retried.\n\nExample: On errors, retry f on an element a maximum of 3 times without any delay between retries.\n\npmap(f, c; retry_delays = zeros(3))\n\nExample: Retry f only if the exception is not of type InexactError, with exponentially increasing delays up to 3 times. Return a NaN in place for all InexactError occurrences.\n\npmap(f, c; on_error = e->(isa(e, InexactError) ? NaN : rethrow(e)), retry_delays = ExponentialBackOff(n = 3))\n\n\n\n"

There are highly optimized implementations of BLAS available for every computer architecture, and sometimes in high-performance linear algebra routines it is useful to call the BLAS functions directly.Base.LinAlg.BLAS provides wrappers for some of the BLAS functions. Those BLAS functions that overwrite one of the input arrays have names ending in '!'.  Usually, a BLAS function has four methods defined, for Float64, Float32, Complex128, and Complex64 arrays."

(Note that the MIME\"\" notation only supports literal strings; to construct MIME types in a more flexible manner use MIME{Symbol(\"\")}.)\n\nFor example, if you define a MyImage type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function show(stream, ::MIME\"image/png\", x::MyImage) = ... to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable Display (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to import Base.show in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function show.\n\nThe default MIME type is MIME\"text/plain\". There is a fallback definition for text/plain output that calls show with 2 arguments. Therefore, this case should be handled by defining a 2-argument show(stream::IO, x::MyType) method.\n\nTechnically, the MIME\"mime\" macro defines a singleton type for the given mime string, which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any given type.\n\nThe first argument to show can be an IOContext specifying output format properties.

Then, for each MIME type (mime string) that can be displayed on D, one should define a function display(d::D, ::MIME\"mime\", x) = ... that displays x as that MIME type, usually by calling reprmime(mime, x).  A MethodError should be thrown if x cannot be displayed as that MIME type; this is automatic if one calls reprmime. Finally, one should define a function display(d::D, x) that queries mimewritable(mime, x) for the mime types supported by D and displays the \"best\" one; a MethodError should be thrown if no supported MIME types are found for x.  Similarly, some subtypes may wish to override redisplay(d::D, ...). (Again, one should import Base.display to add new methods to display.) The return values of these functions are up to the implementation (since in some cases it may be useful to return a display \"handle\" of some type).

    "text": "There are currently four sorting algorithms available in base Julia:InsertionSort\nQuickSort\nPartialQuickSort(k)\nMergeSortInsertionSort is an O(n^2) stable sorting algorithm. It is efficient for very small n, and is used internally by QuickSort.QuickSort is an O(n log n) sorting algorithm which is in-place, very fast, but not stable – i.e. elements which are considered equal will not remain in the same order in which they originally appeared in the array to be sorted. QuickSort is the default algorithm for numeric values, including integers and floats.PartialQuickSort(k) is similar to QuickSort, but the output array is only sorted up to index k if k is an integer, or in the range of k if k is an OrdinalRange. For example:x = rand(1:500, 100)\nk = 50\nk2 = 50:100\ns = sort(x; alg=QuickSort)\nps = sort(x; alg=PartialQuickSort(k))\nqs = sort(x; alg=PartialQuickSort(k2))\nmap(issorted, (s, ps, qs))             # => (true, false, false)\nmap(x->issorted(x[1:k]), (s, ps, qs))  # => (true, true, false)\nmap(x->issorted(x[k2]), (s, ps, qs))   # => (true, false, true)\ns[1:k] == ps[1:k]                      # => true\ns[k2] == qs[k2]                        # => trueMergeSort is an O(n log n) stable sorting algorithm but is not in-place – it requires a temporary array of half the size of the input array – and is typically not quite as fast as QuickSort. It is the default algorithm for non-numeric data.The default sorting algorithms are chosen on the basis that they are fast and stable, or appear to be so. For numeric types indeed, QuickSort is selected as it is faster and indistinguishable in this case from a stable sort (unless the array records its mutations in some way). The stability property comes at a non-negligible cost, so if you don't need it, you may want to explicitly specify your preferred algorithm, e.g. sort!(v, alg=QuickSort).The mechanism by which Julia picks default sorting algorithms is implemented via the Base.Sort.defalg function. It allows a particular algorithm to be registered as the default in all sorting functions for specific arrays. For example, here are the two default methods from sort.jl:defalg(v::AbstractArray) = MergeSort\ndefalg{T<:Number}(v::AbstractArray{T}) = QuickSortAs for numeric arrays, choosing a non-stable default algorithm for array types for which the notion of a stable sort is meaningless (i.e. when two values comparing equal can not be distinguished) may make sense."

For example, the following program, when compiled with julia -O3 generates two SIMD addition instructions (addps) on x86 systems:const m128 = NTuple{4,VecElement{Float32}}\n\nfunction add(a::m128, b::m128)\n    (VecElement(a[1].value+b[1].value),\n     VecElement(a[2].value+b[2].value),\n     VecElement(a[3].value+b[3].value),\n     VecElement(a[4].value+b[4].value))\nend\n\ntriple(c::m128) = add(add(c,c),c)\n\ncode_native(triple,(m128,))However, since the automatic vectorization cannot be relied upon, future use will mostly be via libraries that use llvmcall."

In the lowered form there are fewer types of nodes, all macros are expanded, and all control flow is converted to explicit branches and sequences of statements. The lowered form is constructed by julia-syntax.scm.First we will focus on the lowered form, since it is more important to the compiler.

The 1-argument form arises from the syntax function foo end. In the 1-argument form, the argument is a symbol. If this symbol already names a function in the current scope, nothing happens. If the symbol is undefined, a new function is created and assigned to the identifier specified by the symbol. If the symbol is defined but names a non-function, an error is raised. The definition of \"names a function\" is that the binding is constant, and refers to an object of singleton type. The rationale for this is that an instance of a singleton type uniquely identifies the type to add the method to. When the type has fields, it wouldn't be clear whether the method was being added to the instance or its type.\nThe 4-argument form has the following arguments:\nargs[1]\nA function name, or false if unknown. If a symbol, then the expression first behaves like the 1-argument form above. This argument is ignored from then on. When this is false, it means a method is being added strictly by type, (::T)(x) = x.\nargs[2]\nA SimpleVector of argument type data. args[2][1] is a SimpleVector of the argument types, and args[2][2] is a SimpleVector of type variables corresponding to the method's static parameters.\nargs[3]\nA CodeInfo of the method itself.

First argument is the type. The new pseudo-function is lowered to this, and the type is always inserted by the compiler.  This is very much an internal-only feature, and does no checking. Evaluating arbitrary new expressions can easily segfault.\nreturn\nReturns its argument as the value of the enclosing function.\nthe_exception\nYields the caught exception inside a catch block.

A stack is maintained; if the first argument of this expression is true or false (true means bounds checks are disabled), it is pushed onto the stack. If the first argument is :pop, the stack is popped.\nboundscheck\nIndicates the beginning or end of a section of code that performs a bounds check. Like inbounds, a stack is maintained, and the second argument can be one of: true, false, or :pop.\ncopyast\nPart of the implementation of quasi-quote. The argument is a surface syntax AST that is simply copied recursively and returned at run time.\nmeta\nMetadata. args[1] is typically a symbol specifying the kind of metadata, and the rest of the arguments are free-form. The following kinds of metadata are commonly used:\n:inline and :noinline: Inlining hints.\n:push_loc: enters a sequence of statements from a specified source location.\nargs[2] specifies a filename, as a symbol.\nargs[3] optionally specifies the name of an (inlined) function that originally contained the code.\n:pop_loc: returns to the source location before the matching :push_loc."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "It's perhaps easiest to conceive of Julia's type system in terms of sets. While programs manipulate individual values, a type refers to a set of values. This is not the same thing as a collection; for example a Set of values is itself a single Set value. Rather, a type describes a set of possible values, expressing uncertainty about which value we have.A concrete type T describes the set of values whose direct tag, as returned by the typeof function, is T. An abstract type describes some possibly-larger set of values.Any describes the entire universe of possible values. Integer is a subset of Any that includes Int, Int8, and other concrete types. Internally, Julia also makes heavy use of another type known as Bottom, which can also be written as Union{}. This corresponds to the empty set.Julia's types support the standard operations of set theory: you can ask whether T1 is a \"subset\" (subtype) of T2 with T1 <: T2. Likewise, you intersect two types using typeintersect, take their union with Union, and compute a type that contains their union with typejoin:julia> typeintersect(Int, Float64)\nUnion{}\n\njulia> Union{Int, Float64}\nUnion{Float64, Int64}\n\njulia> typejoin(Int, Float64)\nReal\n\njulia> typeintersect(Signed, Union{UInt8, Int8})\nInt8\n\njulia> Union{Signed, Union{UInt8, Int8}}\nUnion{Signed, UInt8}\n\njulia> typejoin(Signed, Union{UInt8, Int8})\nInteger\n\njulia> typeintersect(Tuple{Integer,Float64}, Tuple{Int,Real})\nTuple{Int64,Float64}\n\njulia> Union{Tuple{Integer,Float64}, Tuple{Int,Real}}\nUnion{Tuple{Int64,Real}, Tuple{Integer,Float64}}\n\njulia> typejoin(Tuple{Integer,Float64}, Tuple{Int,Real})\nTuple{Integer,Real}While these operations may seem abstract, they lie at the heart of Julia.  For example, method dispatch is implemented by stepping through the items in a method list until reaching one for which the type of the argument tuple is a subtype of the method signature. For this algorithm to work, it's important that methods be sorted by their specificity, and that the search begins with the most specific methods. Consequently, Julia also implements a partial order on types; this is achieved by functionality that is similar to <:, but with differences that will be discussed below."

    "title": "UnionAll types",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Julia's type system can also express an iterated union of types: a union of types over all values of some variable. This is needed to describe parametric types where the values of some parameters are not known.For example, :obj:Array has two parameters as in Array{Int,2}. If we did not know the element type, we could write Array{T,2} where T, which is the union of Array{T,2} for all values of T: Union{Array{Int8,2}, Array{Int16,2}, ...}.Such a type is represented by a UnionAll object, which contains a variable (T in this example, of type TypeVar), and a wrapped type (Array{T,2} in this example).Consider the following methods:f1(A::Array) = 1\nf2(A::Array{Int}) = 2\nf3(A::Array{T}) where {T<:Any} = 3\nf4(A::Array{Any}) = 4The signature of f3 is a UnionAll type wrapping a tuple type. All but f4 can be called with a = [1,2]; all but f2 can be called with b = Any[1,2].Let's look at these types a little more closely:julia> dump(Array)\nUnionAll\n  var: TypeVar\n    name: Symbol T\n    lb: Core.TypeofBottom Union{}\n    ub: Any\n  body: UnionAll\n    var: TypeVar\n      name: Symbol N\n      lb: Core.TypeofBottom Union{}\n      ub: Any\n    body: Array{T,N} <: DenseArray{T,N}This indicates that Array actually names a UnionAll type. There is one UnionAll type for each parameter, nested. The syntax Array{Int,2} is equivalent to Array{Int}{2}; internally each UnionAll is instantiated with a particular variable value, one at a time, outermost-first. This gives a natural meaning to the omission of trailing type parameters; Array{Int} gives a type equivalent to Array{Int,N} where N.A TypeVar is not itself a type, but rather should be considered part of the structure of a UnionAll type. Type variables have lower and upper bounds on their values (in the fields lb and ub). The symbol name is purely cosmetic. Internally, TypeVars are compared by address, so they are defined as mutable types to ensure that \"different\" type variables can be distinguished. However, by convention they should not be mutated.One can construct TypeVars manually:julia> TypeVar(:V, Signed, Real)\nSigned<:V<:RealThere are convenience versions that allow you to omit any of these arguments except the name symbol.The syntax Array{T} where T<:Integer is lowered tolet T = TypeVar(:T,Integer)\n    UnionAll(T, Array{T})\nendso it is seldom necessary to construct a TypeVar manually (indeed, this is to be avoided)."

For example, the type Array{Array{V} where V<:Integer} has no free variables, but the Array{V} part inside of it does have a free variable, V.A type with free variables is, in some sense, not really a type at all. Consider the type Array{Array{T}} where T, which refers to all homogeneous arrays of arrays. The inner type Array{T}, seen by itself, might seem to refer to any kind of array. However, every element of the outer array must have the same array type, so Array{T} cannot refer to just any old array. One could say that Array{T} effectively \"occurs\" multiple times, and T must have the same value each \"time\".For this reason, the function jl_has_free_typevars in the C API is very important. Types for which it returns true will not give meaningful answers in subtyping and other type functions."

    "text": "Consider the type Tuple{T,T} where T. A method with this signature would look like:f(x::T, y::T) where {T} = ...According to the usual interpretation of a UnionAll type, this T ranges over all types, including Any, so this type should be equivalent to Tuple{Any,Any}. However, this interpretation causes some practical problems.First, a value of T needs to be available inside the method definition. For a call like f(1, 1.0), it's not clear what T should be. It could be Union{Int,Float64}, or perhaps Real. Intuitively, we expect the declaration x::T to mean T === typeof(x). To make sure that invariant holds, we need typeof(x) === typeof(y) === T in this method. That implies the method should only be called for arguments of the exact same type.It turns out that being able to dispatch on whether two values have the same type is very useful (this is used by the promotion system for example), so we have multiple reasons to want a different interpretation of Tuple{T,T} where T. To make this work we add the following rule to subtyping: if a variable occurs more than once in covariant position, it is restricted to ranging over only concrete types. (\"Covariant position\" means that only Tuple and Union types occur between an occurrence of a variable and the UnionAll type that introduces it.) Such variables are called \"diagonal variables\" or \"concrete variables\".So for example, Tuple{T,T} where T can be seen as Union{Tuple{Int8,Int8}, Tuple{Int16,Int16}, ...}, where T ranges over all concrete types. This gives rise to some interesting subtyping results. For example Tuple{Real,Real} is not a subtype of Tuple{T,T} where T, because it includes some types like Tuple{Int8,Int16} where the two elements have different types. Tuple{Real,Real} and Tuple{T,T} where T have the non-trivial intersection Tuple{T,T} where T<:Real. However, Tuple{Real} is a subtype of Tuple{T} where T, because in that case T occurs only once and so is not diagonal.Next consider a signature like the following:f(a::Array{T}, x::T, y::T) where {T} = ...In this case, T occurs in invariant position inside Array{T}. That means whatever type of array is passed unambiguously determines the value of T –- we say T has an equality constraint on it. Therefore in this case the diagonal rule is not really necessary, since the array determines T and we can then allow x and y to be of any subtypes of T. So variables that occur in invariant position are never considered diagonal. This choice of behavior is slightly controversial –- some feel this definition should be written asf(a::Array{T}, x::S, y::S) where {T, S<:T} = ...to clarify whether x and y need to have the same type. In this version of the signature they would, or we could introduce a third variable for the type of y if x and y can have different types.The next complication is the interaction of unions and diagonal variables, e.g.f(x::Union{Void,T}, y::T) where {T} = ...Consider what this declaration means. y has type T. x then can have either the same type T, or else be of type Void. So all of the following calls should match:f(1, 1)\nf(\"\", \"\")\nf(2.0, 2.0)\nf(nothing, 1)\nf(nothing, \"\")\nf(nothing, 2.0)These examples are telling us something: when x is nothing::Void, there are no extra constraints on y. It is as if the method signature had y::Any. This means that whether a variable is diagonal is not a static property based on where it appears in a type. Rather, it depends on where a variable appears when the subtyping algorithm uses it. When x has type Void, we don't need to use the T in Union{Void,T}, so T does not \"occur\". Indeed, we have the following type equivalence:(Tuple{Union{Void,T},T} where T) == Union{Tuple{Void,Any}, Tuple{T,T} where T}"

    "text": "The subtyping algorithm for diagonal variables has two components: (1) identifying variable occurrences, and (2) ensuring that diagonal variables range over concrete types only.The first task is accomplished by keeping counters occurs_inv and occurs_cov (in src/subtype.c) for each variable in the environment, tracking the number of invariant and covariant occurrences, respectively. A variable is diagonal when occurs_inv == 0 && occurs_cov > 1.The second task is accomplished by imposing a condition on a variable's lower bound. As the subtyping algorithm runs, it narrows the bounds of each variable (raising lower bounds and lowering upper bounds) to keep track of the range of variable values for which the subtype relation would hold. When we are done evaluating the body of a UnionAll type whose variable is diagonal, we look at the final values of the bounds. Since the variable must be concrete, a contradiction occurs if its lower bound could not be a subtype of a concrete type. For example, an abstract type like AbstractArray cannot be a subtype of a concrete type, but a concrete type like Int can be, and the empty type Bottom can be as well. If a lower bound fails this test the algorithm stops with the answer false.For example, in the problem Tuple{Int,String} <: Tuple{T,T} where T, we derive that this would be true if T were a supertype of Union{Int,String}. However, Union{Int,String} is an abstract type, so the relation does not hold.This concreteness test is done by the function is_leaf_bound. Note that this test is slightly different from jl_is_leaf_type, since it also returns true for Bottom. Currently this function is heuristic, and does not catch all possible concrete types. The difficulty is that whether a lower bound is concrete might depend on the values of other type variable bounds. For example, Vector{T} is equivalent to the concrete type Vector{Int} only if both the upper and lower bounds of T equal Int. We have not yet worked out a complete algorithm for this."

From there, type_morespecific employs some less formal rules. For example, subtype is sensitive to the number of arguments, but type_morespecific may not be. In particular, Tuple{Int,AbstractFloat} is more specific than Tuple{Integer}, even though it is not a subtype.  (Of Tuple{Int,AbstractFloat} and Tuple{Integer,Float64}, neither is more specific than the other.)  Likewise, Tuple{Int,Vararg{Int}} is not a subtype of Tuple{Integer}, but it is considered more specific.

The jl_typeof() function can be used to query for it:jl_value_t *jl_typeof(jl_value_t *v);The layout of the object depends on its type. Reflection methods can be used to inspect that layout. A field can be accessed by calling one of the get-field methods:jl_value_t *jl_get_nth_field_checked(jl_value_t *v, size_t i);\njl_value_t *jl_get_field(jl_value_t *o, char *fld);If the field types are known, a priori, to be all pointers, the values can also be extracted directly as an array access:jl_value_t *v = value->fieldptr[n];As an example, a \"boxed\" uint16_t is stored as follows:struct {\n    opaque metadata;\n    struct {\n        uint16_t data;        // -- 2 bytes\n    } jl_value_t;\n};This object is created by jl_box_uint16(). Note that the jl_value_t pointer references the data portion, not the metadata at the top of the struct.A value may be stored \"unboxed\" in many circumstances (just the data, without the metadata, and possibly not even stored but just kept in registers), so it is unsafe to assume that the address of a box is a unique identifier. The \"egal\" test (corresponding to the === function in Julia), should instead be used to compare two unknown objects for equivalence:int jl_egal(jl_value_t *a, jl_value_t *b);This optimization should be relatively transparent to the API, since the object will be \"boxed\" on-demand, whenever a jl_value_t pointer is needed.Note that modification of a jl_value_t pointer in memory is permitted only if the object is mutable. Otherwise, modification of the value may corrupt the program and the result will be undefined. The mutability property of a value can be queried for with:int jl_is_mutable(jl_value_t *v);If the object being stored is a jl_value_t, the Julia garbage collector must be notified also:void jl_gc_wb(jl_value_t *parent, jl_value_t *ptr);However, the Embedding Julia section of the manual is also required reading at this point, for covering other details of boxing and unboxing various types, and understanding the gc interactions.Mirror structs for some of the built-in types are defined in julia.h.

This is because the type might have parameters, and so needs to take part in dispatch. This tuple type is looked up in the method table.This dispatch process is performed by jl_apply_generic, which takes two arguments: a pointer to an array of the values f, x, and y, and the number of values (in this case 3).Throughout the system, there are two kinds of APIs that handle functions and argument lists: those that accept the function and arguments separately, and those that accept a single argument structure. In the first kind of API, the \"arguments\" part does not contain information about the function, since that is passed separately. In the second kind of API, the function is the first element of the argument structure.For example, the following function for performing a call accepts just an args pointer, so the first element of the args array will be the function to call:jl_value_t *jl_apply(jl_value_t **args, uint32_t nargs)This entry point for the same functionality accepts the function separately, so the args array does not contain the function:jl_value_t *jl_call(jl_function_t *f, jl_value_t **args, int32_t nargs);"

    "text": "Keyword arguments work by associating a special, hidden function object with each method table that has definitions with keyword arguments. This function is called the \"keyword argument sorter\" or \"keyword sorter\", or \"kwsorter\", and is stored in the kwsorter field of MethodTable objects. Every definition in the kwsorter function has the same arguments as some definition in the normal method table, except with a single Array argument prepended. This array contains alternating symbols and values that represent the passed keyword arguments. The kwsorter's job is to move keyword arguments into their canonical positions based on name, plus evaluate and substite any needed default value expressions. The result is a normal positional argument list, which is then passed to yet another function.The easiest way to understand the process is to look at how a keyword argument method definition is lowered. The code:function circle(center, radius; color = black, fill::Bool = true, options...)\n    # draw\nendactually produces three method definitions. The first is a function that accepts all arguments (including keywords) as positional arguments, and includes the code for the method body. It has an auto-generated name:function #circle#1(color, fill::Bool, options, circle, center, radius)\n    # draw\nendThe second method is an ordinary definition for the original circle function, which handles the case where no keyword arguments are passed:function circle(center, radius)\n    #circle#1(black, true, Any[], circle, center, radius)\nendThis simply dispatches to the first method, passing along default values. Finally there is the kwsorter definition:function (::Core.kwftype(typeof(circle)))(kw::Array, circle, center, radius)\n    options = Any[]\n    color = arg associated with :color, or black if not found\n    fill = arg associated with :fill, or true if not found\n    # push remaining elements of kw into options array\n    #circle#1(color, fill, options, circle, center, radius)\nendThe front end generates code to loop over the kw array and pick out arguments in the right order, evaluating default expressions when an argument is not found.The function Core.kwftype(t) fetches (and creates, if necessary) the field t.name.mt.kwsorter.This design has the feature that call sites that don't use keyword arguments require no special handling; everything works as if they were not part of the language at all. Call sites that do use keyword arguments are dispatched directly to the called function's kwsorter. For example the call:circle((0,0), 1.0, color = red; other...)is lowered to:kwfunc(circle)(Any[:color,red,other...], circle, (0,0), 1.0)The unpacking procedure represented here as other... actually further unpacks each element of other, expecting each one to contain two values (a symbol and a value). kwfunc (also in Core) fetches the kwsorter for the called function. Notice that the original circle function is passed through, to handle closures."

    "title": "Compiler efficiency issues",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Generating a new type for every function has potentially serious consequences for compiler resource use when combined with Julia's \"specialize on all arguments by default\" design. Indeed, the initial implementation of this design suffered from much longer build and test times, higher memory use, and a system image nearly 2x larger than the baseline. In a naive implementation, the problem is bad enough to make the system nearly unusable. Several significant optimizations were needed to make the design practical.The first issue is excessive specialization of functions for different values of function-valued arguments. Many functions simply \"pass through\" an argument to somewhere else, e.g. to another function or to a storage location. Such functions do not need to be specialized for every closure that might be passed in. Fortunately this case is easy to distinguish by simply considering whether a function calls one of its arguments (i.e. the argument appears in \"head position\" somewhere). Performance-critical higher-order functions like map certainly call their argument function and so will still be specialized as expected. This optimization is implemented by recording which arguments are called during the analyze-variables pass in the front end. When cache_method sees an argument in the Function type hierarchy passed to a slot declared as Any or Function, it pretends the slot was declared as ANY (the \"don't specialize\" hint). This heuristic seems to be extremely effective in practice.The next issue concerns the structure of method cache hash tables. Empirical studies show that the vast majority of dynamically-dispatched calls involve one or two arguments. In turn, many of these cases can be resolved by considering only the first argument. (Aside: proponents of single dispatch would not be surprised by this at all. However, this argument means \"multiple dispatch is easy to optimize in practice\", and that we should therefore use it, not \"we should use single dispatch\"!) So the method cache uses the type of the first argument as its primary key. Note, however, that this corresponds to the second element of the tuple type for a function call (the first element being the type of the function itself). Typically, type variation in head position is extremely low – indeed, the majority of functions belong to singleton types with no parameters. However, this is not the case for constructors, where a single method table holds constructors for every type. Therefore the Type method table is special-cased to use the first tuple type element instead of the second.The front end generates type declarations for all closures. Initially, this was implemented by generating normal type declarations. However, this produced an extremely large number of constructors, all of which were trivial (simply passing all arguments through to new). Since methods are partially ordered, inserting all of these methods is O(n^2), plus there are just too many of them to keep around. This was optimized by generating composite_type expressions directly (bypassing default constructor generation), and using new directly to create closure instances. Not the prettiest thing ever, but you do what you gotta do.The next problem was the @test macro, which generated a 0-argument closure for each test case. This is not really necessary, since each test case is simply run once in place. Therefore I modified @test to expand to a try-catch block that records the test result (true, false, or exception raised) and calls the test suite handler on it.However this caused a new problem. When many tests are grouped together in a single function, e.g. a single top level expression, or some other test grouping function, that function could have a very large number of exception handlers. This triggered a kind of dataflow analysis worst case, where type inference spun around for minutes enumerating possible paths through the forest of handlers. This was fixed by simply bailing out of type inference when it encounters more than some number of handlers (currently 25). Presumably no performance-critical function will have more than 25 exception handlers. If one ever does, I'm willing to raise the limit to 26.A minor issue occurs during the bootstrap process due to storing all constructors in a single method table. In the second bootstrap step, where inference.ji is compiled using inference0.ji, constructors for inference0's types remain in the table, so there are still references to the old inference module and inference.ji is 2x the size it should be. This was fixed in dump.c by filtering definitions from \"replaced modules\" out of method tables and caches before saving a system image. A \"replaced module\" is one that satisfies the condition m != jl_get_global(m->parent, m->name) – in other words, some newer module has taken its name and place.Another type inference worst case was triggered by the following code from the QuadGK.jl package, formerly part of Base:function do_quadgk(f, s, n, ::Type{Tw}, abstol, reltol, maxevals, nrm) where Tw\n    if eltype(s) <: Real # check for infinite or semi-infinite intervals\n        s1 = s[1]; s2 = s[end]; inf1 = isinf(s1); inf2 = isinf(s2)\n        if inf1 || inf2\n            if inf1 && inf2 # x = t/(1-t^2) coordinate transformation\n                return do_quadgk(t -> begin t2 = t*t; den = 1 / (1 - t2);\n                                            f(t*den) * (1+t2)*den*den; end,\n                                 map(x -> isinf(x) ? copysign(one(x), x) : 2x / (1+hypot(1,2x)), s),\n                                 n, Tw, abstol, reltol, maxevals, nrm)\n            end\n            s0,si = inf1 ? (s2,s1) : (s1,s2)\n            if si < 0 # x = s0 - t/(1-t)\n                return do_quadgk(t -> begin den = 1 / (1 - t);\n                                            f(s0 - t*den) * den*den; end,\n                                 reverse!(map(x -> 1 / (1 + 1 / (s0 - x)), s)),\n                                 n, Tw, abstol, reltol, maxevals, nrm)\n            else # x = s0 + t/(1-t)\n                return do_quadgk(t -> begin den = 1 / (1 - t);\n                                            f(s0 + t*den) * den*den; end,\n                                 map(x -> 1 / (1 + 1 / (x - s0)), s),\n                                 n, Tw, abstol, reltol, maxevals, nrm)\n            end\n        end\n    endThis code has a 3-way tail recursion, where each call wraps the current function argument f in a different new closure. Inference must consider 3^n (where n is the call depth) possible signatures. This blows up way too quickly, so logic was added to typeinf_uncached to immediately widen any argument that is a subtype of Function and that grows in depth down the stack."

As an example, consider the implementation of the @inline macro:macro inline(ex)\n    esc(isa(ex, Expr) ? pushmeta!(ex, :inline) : ex)\nendHere, ex is expected to be an expression defining a function. A statement like this:@inline function myfunction(x)\n    x*(x+3)\nendgets turned into an expression like this:quote\n    function myfunction(x)\n        Expr(:meta, :inline)\n        x*(x+3)\n    end\nendBase.pushmeta!(ex, :symbol, args...) appends :symbol to the end of the :meta expression, creating a new :meta expression if necessary.

If your implementation can be performed within Julia, Base.popmeta! is very handy: Base.popmeta!(body, :symbol) will scan a function body expression (one without the function signature) for the first :meta expression containing :symbol, extract any arguments, and return a tuple (found::Bool, args::Array{Any}). If the metadata did not have any arguments, or :symbol was not found, the args array will be empty.Not yet provided is a convenient infrastructure for parsing :meta expressions from C++."

    "title": "Indexing: cartesian vs. linear indexing",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Broadly speaking, there are two main ways to access data in an array. The first, often called cartesian indexing, uses N indexes for an N -dimensional AbstractArray.  For example, a matrix A (2-dimensional) can be indexed in cartesian style as A[i,j].  The second indexing method, referred to as linear indexing, uses a single index even for higher-dimensional objects.  For example, if A = reshape(1:12, 3, 4), then the expression A[5] returns the value 5.  Julia allows you to combine these styles of indexing: for example, a 3d array A3 can be indexed as A3[i,j], in which case i is interpreted as a cartesian index for the first dimension, and j is a linear index over dimensions 2 and 3.For Arrays, linear indexing appeals to the underlying storage format: an array is laid out as a contiguous block of memory, and hence the linear index is just the offset (+1) of the corresponding entry relative to the beginning of the array.  However, this is not true for many other AbstractArray types: examples include SparseMatrixCSC, arrays that require some kind of computation (such as interpolation), and the type under discussion here, SubArray.  For these types, the underlying information is more naturally described in terms of cartesian indexes.You can manually convert from a cartesian index to a linear index with sub2ind, and vice versa using ind2sub.  getindex and setindex! functions for AbstractArray types may include similar operations.While converting from a cartesian index to a linear index is fast (it's just multiplication and addition), converting from a linear index to a cartesian index is very slow: it relies on the div operation, which is one of the slowest low-level operations you can perform with a CPU.  For this reason, any code that deals with AbstractArray types is best designed in terms of cartesian, rather than linear, indexing."

Consequently, the natural way to index these is with S1[i,j].  To extract the value from the parent array A, the natural approach is to replace S1[i,j] with A[i,5,(2:6)[j]] and S2[i,j] with A[5,i,(2:6)[j]].The key feature of the design of SubArrays is that this index replacement can be performed without any runtime overhead."

The first two are the standard element type and dimensionality.  The next is the type of the parent AbstractArray.  The most heavily-used is the fourth parameter, a Tuple of the types of the indices for each dimension. The final one, L, is only provided as a convenience for dispatch; it's a boolean that represents whether the index types support fast linear indexing. More on that later.If in our example above A is a Array{Float64, 3}, our S1 case above would be a SubArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,3},Tuple{Colon,Int64,UnitRange{Int64}},false}.

For example, for S1, one needs to apply the i,j indices to the first and third dimensions of the parent array, whereas for S2 one needs to apply them to the second and third.  The simplest approach to indexing would be to do the type-analysis at runtime:parentindexes = Array{Any}(0)\nfor thisindex in S.indexes\n    ...\n    if isa(thisindex, Int)\n        # Don't consume one of the input indexes\n        push!(parentindexes, thisindex)\n    elseif isa(thisindex, AbstractVector)\n        # Consume an input index\n        push!(parentindexes, thisindex[inputindex[j]])\n        j += 1\n    elseif isa(thisindex, AbstractMatrix)\n        # Consume two input indices\n        push!(parentindexes, thisindex[inputindex[j], inputindex[j+1]])\n        j += 2\n    elseif ...\nend\nS.parent[parentindexes...]Unfortunately, this would be disastrous in terms of performance: each element access would allocate memory, and involves the running of a lot of poorly-typed code.The better approach is to dispatch to specific methods to handle each type of stored index. That's what reindex does: it dispatches on the type of the first stored index and consumes the appropriate number of input indices, and then it recurses on the remaining indices. In the case of S1, this expands toBase.reindex(S1, S1.indexes, (i, j)) == (i, S1.indexes[2], S1.indexes[3][j])for any pair of indices (i,j) (except CartesianIndexs and arrays thereof, see below).This is the core of a SubArray; indexing methods depend upon reindex to do this index translation. Sometimes, though, we can avoid the indirection and make it even faster."

    "text": "Linear indexing can be implemented efficiently when the entire array has a single stride that separates successive elements, starting from some offset. This means that we can pre-compute these values and represent linear indexing simply as an addition and multiplication, avoiding the indirection of reindex and (more importantly) the slow computation of the cartesian coordinates entirely.For SubArray types, the availability of efficient linear indexing is based purely on the types of the indices, and does not depend on values like the size of the parent array. You can ask whether a given set of indices supports fast linear indexing with the internal Base.viewindexing function:julia> Base.viewindexing(S1.indexes)\nIndexCartesian()\n\njulia> Base.viewindexing(S2.indexes)\nIndexLinear()This is computed during construction of the SubArray and stored in the L type parameter as a boolean that encodes fast linear indexing support. While not strictly necessary, it means that we can define dispatch directly on SubArray{T,N,A,I,true} without any intermediaries.Since this computation doesn't depend on runtime values, it can miss some cases in which the stride happens to be uniform:julia> A = reshape(1:4*2, 4, 2)\n4×2 Base.ReshapedArray{Int64,2,UnitRange{Int64},Tuple{}}:\n 1  5\n 2  6\n 3  7\n 4  8\n\njulia> diff(A[2:2:4,:][:])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 2\n 2A view constructed as view(A, 2:2:4, :) happens to have uniform stride, and therefore linear indexing indeed could be performed efficiently.  However, success in this case depends on the size of the array: if the first dimension instead were odd,julia> A = reshape(1:5*2, 5, 2)\n5×2 Base.ReshapedArray{Int64,2,UnitRange{Int64},Tuple{}}:\n 1   6\n 2   7\n 3   8\n 4   9\n 5  10\n\njulia> diff(A[2:2:4,:][:])\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 3\n 2then A[2:2:4,:] does not have uniform stride, so we cannot guarantee efficient linear indexing.

    "text": "Note that the Base.reindex function is agnostic to the types of the input indices; it simply determines how and where the stored indices should be reindexed. It not only supports integer indices, but it supports non-scalar indexing, too. This means that views of views don't need two levels of indirection; they can simply re-compute the indices into the original parent array!\nHopefully by now it's fairly clear that supporting slices means that the dimensionality, given by the parameter N, is not necessarily equal to the dimensionality of the parent array or the length of the indexes tuple.  Neither do user-supplied indices necessarily line up with entries in the indexes tuple (e.g., the second user-supplied index might correspond to the third dimension of the parent array, and the third element in the indexes tuple).\nWhat might be less obvious is that the dimensionality of the stored parent array must be equal to the number of effective indices in the indexes tuple. Some examples:\nA = reshape(1:35, 5, 7) # A 2d parent Array\nS = view(A, 2:7)         # A 1d view created by linear indexing\nS = view(A, :, :, 1:1)   # Appending extra indices is supported\nNaively, you'd think you could just set S.parent = A and S.indexes = (:,:,1:1), but supporting this dramatically complicates the reindexing process, especially for views of views. Not only do you need to dispatch on the types of the stored indices, but you need to examine whether a given index is the final one and \"merge\" any remaining stored indices together. This is not an easy task, and even worse: it's slow since it implicitly depends upon linear indexing.\nFortunately, this is precisely the computation that ReshapedArray performs, and it does so linearly if possible. Consequently, view ensures that the parent array is the appropriate dimensionality for the given indices by reshaping it if needed. The inner SubArray constructor ensures that this invariant is satisfied.\nCartesianIndex and arrays thereof throw a nasty wrench into the reindex scheme. Recall that reindex simply dispatches on the type of the stored indices in order to determine how many passed indices should be used and where they should go. But with CartesianIndex, there's no longer a one-to-one correspondence between the number of passed arguments and the number of dimensions that they index into. If we return to the above example of Base.reindex(S1, S1.indexes, (i, j)), you can see that the expansion is incorrect for i, j = CartesianIndex(), CartesianIndex(2,1). It should skip the CartesianIndex() entirely and return:\n(CartesianIndex(2,1)[1], S1.indexes[2], S1.indexes[3][CartesianIndex(2,1)[2]])\nInstead, though, we get:\n(CartesianIndex(), S1.indexes[2], S1.indexes[3][CartesianIndex(2,1)])\nDoing this correctly would require combined dispatch on both the stored and passed indices across all combinations of dimensionalities in an intractable manner. As such, reindex must never be called with CartesianIndex indices. Fortunately, the scalar case is easily handled by first flattening the CartesianIndex arguments to plain integers. Arrays of CartesianIndex, however, cannot be split apart into orthogonal pieces so easily. Before attempting to use reindex, view must ensure that there are no arrays of CartesianIndex in the argument list. If there are, it can simply \"punt\" by avoiding the reindex calculation entirely, constructing a nested SubArray with two levels of indirection instead."

The best strategy is to create a code example in a form where you can use LLVM's opt tool to study it and the pass of interest in isolation.Create an example Julia code of interest.\nUse JULIA_LLVM_ARGS = -print-after-all to dump the IR.\nPick out the IR at the point just before the pass of interest runs.\nStrip the debug metadata and fix up the TBAA metadata by hand.The last step is labor intensive.

In tight inner loops or other performance critical situations, you may wish to skip these bounds checks to improve runtime performance. For instance, in order to emit vectorized (SIMD) instructions, your loop body cannot contain branches, and thus cannot contain bounds checks. Consequently, Julia includes an @inbounds(...) macro to tell the compiler to skip such bounds checks within the given block. For the built-in Array type, the magic happens inside the arrayref and arrayset intrinsics. User-defined array types instead use the @boundscheck(...) macro to achieve context-sensitive code selection."

When the @boundscheck(...) is nested inside of a calling function containing an @inbounds(...), the compiler will remove the @boundscheck block only if it is inlined into the calling function. For example, you might write the method sum as:function sum(A::AbstractArray)\n    r = zero(eltype(A))\n    for i = 1:length(A)\n        @inbounds r += A[i]\n    end\n    return r\nendWith a custom array-like type MyArray having:@inline getindex(A::MyArray, i::Real) = (@boundscheck checkbounds(A,i); A.data[to_index(i)])Then when getindex is inlined into sum, the call to checkbounds(A,i) will be elided. If your function contains multiple layers of inlining, only @boundscheck blocks at most one level of inlining deeper are eliminated.

Indices are specified as tuples, and are usually compared in a 1-1 fashion with individual dimensions handled by calling another important function, checkindex: typically,checkbounds_indices(Bool, (IA1, IA...), (I1, I...)) = checkindex(Bool, IA1, I1) &\n                                                      checkbounds_indices(Bool, IA, I)so checkindex checks a single dimension.  All of these functions, including the unexported checkbounds_indices have docstrings accessible with ? .If you have to customize bounds checking for a specific array type, you should specialize checkbounds(Bool, A, I...). However, in most cases you should be able to rely on checkbounds_indices as long as you supply useful indices for your array type.If you have novel index types, first consider specializing checkindex, which handles a single index for a particular dimension of an array.  If you have a custom multidimensional index type (similar to CartesianIndex), then you may have to consider specializing checkbounds_indices.Note this hierarchy has been designed to reduce the likelihood of method ambiguities.  We try to make checkbounds the place to specialize on array type, and try to avoid specializations on index types; conversely, checkindex is intended to be specialized only on index type (especially, the last argument)."

Such array types are expected to be supplied through packages.The purpose of this page is to address the question, \"what do I have to do to support such arrays in my own code?\"  First, let's address the simplest case: if you know that your code will never need to handle arrays with unconventional indexing, hopefully the answer is \"nothing.\" Old code, on conventional arrays, should function essentially without alteration as long as it was using the exported interfaces of Julia."

Previously that was a safe assumption, so this code was fine, but (depending on what types the user passes to this function) it may no longer be safe.  If this code continued to work when passed a vector with non-1 indices, it would either produce an incorrect answer or it would segfault.  (If you do get segfaults, to help locate the cause try running julia with the option --check-bounds=yes.)To ensure that such errors are caught, in Julia 0.5 both length and sizeshould throw an error when passed an array with non-1 indexing.

For any new AbstractArray type, this is the default returned by indices, and it indicates that this array type uses \"conventional\" 1-based indexing.

However, this raises an ambiguity for one-dimensional arrays (a.k.a., AbstractVector): does v[i] mean linear indexing, or Cartesian indexing with the array's native indices?For this reason, if you want to use linear indexing in an algorithm, your best option is to get the index range by calling linearindices(A).  This will return indices(A, 1) if A is an AbstractVector, and the equivalent of 1:length(A) otherwise.In a sense, one can say that 1-dimensional arrays always use Cartesian indexing. To help enforce this, it's worth noting that sub2ind(shape, i...) and ind2sub(shape, ind) will throw an error if shape indicates a 1-dimensional array with unconventional indexing (i.e., is a Tuple{UnitRange} rather than a tuple of OneTo).

First, if A has conventional indices, then similar(Array{Int}, indices(A)) would end up calling Array{Int}(size(A)), and thus return an array.  If A is an AbstractArray type with unconventional indexing, then similar(Array{Int}, indices(A)) should return something that \"behaves like\" an Array{Int} but with a shape (including indices) that matches A.  (The most obvious implementation is to allocate an Array{Int}(size(A)) and then \"wrap\" it in a type that shifts the indices.)Note also that similar(Array{Int}, (indices(A, 2),)) would allocate an AbstractVector{Int} (i.e., 1-dimensional array) that matches the indices of the columns of A."

    "text": "Writing code that doesn't make assumptions about indexing requires a few extra abstractions, but hopefully the necessary changes are relatively straightforward.As a reminder, this support is still experimental. While much of Julia's base code has been updated to support unconventional indexing, without a doubt there are many omissions that will be discovered only through usage.  Moreover, at the time of this writing, most packages do not support unconventional indexing.  As a consequence, early adopters should be prepared to identify and/or fix bugs.  On the other hand, only through practical usage will it become clear whether this experimental feature should be retained in future versions of Julia; consequently, interested parties are encouraged to accept some ownership for putting it through its paces."

Next, manually run the bootstrap process inside of gdb:$ cd base/\n$ gdb -x ../contrib/debug_bootstrap.gdbThis will start gdb, attempt to run the bootstrap process using the debug build of Julia, and print out a backtrace if (when) it segfaults.

If you are debugging some code that uses the profiler or multiple threads, you may want to let the debugger ignore these signals since they can be triggered very often during normal operations. The command to do this in GDB is (replace SIGSEGV with SIGUSRS or other signals you want to ignore):(gdb) handle SIGSEGV noprint nostop passThe corresponding LLDB command is (after the process is started):(lldb) pro hand -p true -s false -n false SIGSEGVIf you are debugging a segfault with threaded code, you can set a breakpoint on jl_critical_error (sigdie_handler should also work on Linux and BSD) in order to only catch the actual segfault rather than the GC synchronization points."

    "text": "Errors that occur during make need special handling. Julia is built in two stages, constructing sys0 and sys.ji. To see what commands are running at the time of failure, use make VERBOSE=1.At the time of this writing, you can debug build errors during the sys0 phase from the base directory using:julia/base$ gdb --args ../usr/bin/julia-debug -C native --build ../usr/lib/julia/sys0 sysimg.jlYou might need to delete all the files in usr/lib/julia/ to get this to work.You can debug the sys.ji phase using:julia/base$ gdb --args ../usr/bin/julia-debug -C native --build ../usr/lib/julia/sys -J ../usr/lib/julia/sys0.ji sysimg.jlBy default, any errors will cause Julia to exit, even under gdb. To catch an error \"in the act\", set a breakpoint in jl_error (there are several other useful spots, for specific kinds of failures, including: jl_too_few_args, jl_too_many_args, and jl_throw).Once an error is caught, a useful technique is to walk up the stack and examine the function by inspecting the related call to jl_apply. To take a real-world example:Breakpoint 1, jl_throw (e=0x7ffdf42de400) at task.c:802\n802 {\n(gdb) p jl_(e)\nErrorException(\"auto_unbox: unable to determine argument type\")\n$2 = void\n(gdb) bt 10\n#0  jl_throw (e=0x7ffdf42de400) at task.c:802\n#1  0x00007ffff65412fe in jl_error (str=0x7ffde56be000 <_j_str267> \"auto_unbox:\n   unable to determine argument type\")\n   at builtins.c:39\n#2  0x00007ffde56bd01a in julia_convert_16886 ()\n#3  0x00007ffff6541154 in jl_apply (f=0x7ffdf367f630, args=0x7fffffffc2b0, nargs=2) at julia.h:1281\n...The most recent jl_apply is at frame #3, so we can go back there and look at the AST for the function julia_convert_16886. This is the uniqued name for some method of convert. f in this frame is a jl_function_t*, so we can look at the type signature, if any, from the specTypes field:(gdb) f 3\n#3  0x00007ffff6541154 in jl_apply (f=0x7ffdf367f630, args=0x7fffffffc2b0, nargs=2) at julia.h:1281\n1281            return f->fptr((jl_value_t*)f, args, nargs);\n(gdb) p f->linfo->specTypes\n$4 = (jl_tupletype_t *) 0x7ffdf39b1030\n(gdb) p jl_( f->linfo->specTypes )\nTuple{Type{Float32}, Float64}           # <-- type signature for julia_convert_16886Then, we can look at the AST for this function:(gdb) p jl_( jl_uncompress_ast(f->linfo, f->linfo->ast) )\nExpr(:lambda, Array{Any, 1}[:#s29, :x], Array{Any, 1}[Array{Any, 1}[], Array{Any, 1}[Array{Any, 1}[:#s29, :Any, 0], Array{Any, 1}[:x, :Any, 0]], Array{Any, 1}[], 0], Expr(:body,\nExpr(:line, 90, :float.jl)::Any,\nExpr(:return, Expr(:call, :box, :Float32, Expr(:call, :fptrunc, :Float32, :x)::Any)::Any)::Any)::Any)::AnyFinally, and perhaps most usefully, we can force the function to be recompiled in order to step through the codegen process. To do this, clear the cached functionObject from the jl_lamdbda_info_t*:(gdb) p f->linfo->functionObject\n$8 = (void *) 0x1289d070\n(gdb) set f->linfo->functionObject = NULLThen, set a breakpoint somewhere useful (e.g. emit_function, emit_expr, emit_call, etc.), and run codegen:(gdb) p jl_compile(f)\n... # your breakpoint here"

    "text": "Module precompilation spawns a separate Julia process to precompile each module. Setting a breakpoint or catching failures in a precompile worker requires attaching a debugger to the worker. The easiest approach is to set the debugger watch for new process launches matching a given name. For example:(gdb) attach -w -n julia-debugor:(lldb) process attach -w -n julia-debugThen run a script/command to start precompilation. As described earlier, use conditional breakpoints in the parent process to catch specific file-loading events and narrow the debugging window.

    "text": "By default, Valgrind assumes that there is no self modifying code in the programs it runs.  This assumption works fine in most instances but fails miserably for a just-in-time compiler like julia.  For this reason it is crucial to pass --smc-check=all-non-file to valgrind, else code may crash or behave unexpectedly (often in subtle ways).In some cases, to better detect memory errors using Valgrind it can help to compile julia with memory pools disabled.  The compile-time flag MEMDEBUG disables memory pools in Julia, and MEMDEBUG2 disables memory pools in FemtoLisp.  To build julia with both flags, add the following line to Make.user:CFLAGS = -DMEMDEBUG -DMEMDEBUG2Another thing to note: if your program uses multiple workers processes, it is likely that you want all such worker processes to run under Valgrind, not just the parent process.  To do this, pass --trace-children=yes to valgrind."

This will enable the minimal Valgrind machinery but will also run much faster than when the full memory checker is enabled."

This implies that the LLVM version of your host compiler matches that of the LLVM library used within Julia.An easy solution is to have an dedicated build folder for providing a matching toolchain, by building with BUILD_LLVM_CLANG=1 and overriding LLVM_USE_CMAKE=1 (Autotool-based builds are incompatible with ASAN). You can then refer to this toolchain from another build folder by specifying USECLANG=1 while overriding the CC and CXX variables."

    "text": "For detecting or debugging memory bugs, you can use Clang's address sanitizer (ASAN). By compiling with SANITIZE=1 you enable ASAN for the Julia compiler and its generated code. In addition, you can specify LLVM_SANITIZE=1 to sanitize the LLVM library as well. Note that these options incur a high performance and memory cost. For example, using ASAN for Julia and LLVM makes testall1 takes 8-10 times as long while using 20 times as much memory (this can be reduced to respectively a factor of 3 and 4 by using the options described below).By default, Julia sets the allow_user_segv_handler=1 ASAN flag, which is required for signal delivery to work properly. You can define other options using the ASAN_OPTIONS environment flag, in which case you'll need to repeat the default option mentioned before. For example, memory usage can be reduced by specifying fast_unwind_on_malloc=0 and malloc_context_size=2, at the cost of backtrace accuracy. For now, Julia also sets detect_leaks=0, but this should be removed in the future."
